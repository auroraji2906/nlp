Are you having fun?\nMatty: Sounds interesting I've gotta say. Particularly the bacteria stuff! I've been on a walk today so quite tired from that. And I'm enjoying uni yeah! Very very busy. Starting dissertation stuff soon and had a lot of work for essays\nElla: Did you take any photos whilst on your walk? :D So... what does your dissertation stuff look like? Are you in any Uni groups?\nMatty: Got some yeah :) posted one to Facebook. Mine is looking like geography and politics related. Not sure about uni groups? What's your dissertation on if you have to do one?\nElla: We don't really have dissertations... at the end of my third year I'll be writing my degree, so that will be like a slightly longer lab report :) Geography and politics - hmmm... that's  a pretty wide topic, I mean, you could talk about Global warming etc. right?\nMatty: Aah ok. So the long report is a big part of your degree and counts a lot towards it?\nMatty: And it's very wide the topic. Can talk about that yes, can also do social and cultural stuff too in there\nElla: Yeah, basically my grades and my report make up my degree :) Social and cultural stuff... like what?\nMatty: Aaah cool :D I have exams too which make mine up haha. Lucky you\nMatty: And stuff like social separation and classes and how everything plays into each other and culture is like heritage and what matters to different people\nElla: I meant grades from exams, so I don't know if I'm really that lucky :P That's actually really interesting! So how do you prepare for this? Do you get to interview people?\nMatty: Oh right haha. And I have to do loads of reading and prepare some fieldwork. And I likely will have to inerview people yeah. What kind of things do you do in the lab?\nElla: Depends on your field of study - I'm doing Embriology, so I basically conduct experiments on mouse oocytes that should hopefully give some decent results. But other people can grow bacteria on petri dishes if they're doing Microbiology, or study particular fragments of DNA if they're doing Genetics\nElla: It really depends on what you're studying - Biology has a pretty large spectrum, afterall :)", "raw_output": "Ella and Matty are both busy with the workload at university.
