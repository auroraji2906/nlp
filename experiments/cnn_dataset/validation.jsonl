{"raw_input": "A woman has sparked uproar on social media after enthusiastically bearing her K-cup breasts on Google Street View. Karen Davis from Port Pirie in South Australia was captured streaking by the Google camera cars for the popular Google Maps app, which allows users to zoom in on certain streets and towns in cities all over the world with a 360-degree view. However the 38-year-old mother, who plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday, has hit back at 'flat-tittie chicks' claiming they are not confident enough with their own bodies and should focus on how they look. Karen Davis (pictured) from Port Pirie has caused controversy after a picture appeared on Google Maps Street View showing her bearing her size-K breasts . In the image, Ms Davis can be seen holding her arms up in the air with her T-shirt hunched up around her neck bearing her breasts, as she follows the Google camera cars around the street. Her sons are playing in the background and an unknown man stands at the fence watching. Across the road, a neighbour is lounging on her outdoor furniture, watching the whole thing unfold. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Davis was in tears over the nasty comments coming from her community after she was branded a 'bad mother' and 'pure filth' for her raunchy behaviour. 'They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies,' she said. Posting on her Facebook account, Ms Davis addressed the fact that she pursued the car through Barry Street in Port Pirie until they got the perfect shot and believes locals are jealous of her antics. 'Haters hate, you got the guts to do it?' she posted on Facebook after the photo went public. Ms Davis had issues with her siz-K breasts in her 20's and is finally ready to embrace them and she plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday . 'All the flat-tittie chicks think I am disgusting. Big-boob envy has hit Port Pirie.' Taking to Facebook, disgusted commenters attacked Ms Davis' parenting skills after it became clear that her two sons were in the background of the picture. 'I'm sure your children will be proud of their mother that is probably going to cause them a lot of embarrassment,' one Facebook commenter said. 'Oh goodness. Can't even begin to imagine how her children are feeling,' another user said. However a select few came out in support of Ms Davis's show on Google Maps. The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny . 'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online. 'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said. Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did. Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies . 'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them. Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 'I  always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door . She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia. 'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received. 'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.' Some people online have suggested that she should be formally charged for her display but she has contacted the police who have confirmed that they have 'no concerns'.", "raw_output": "A woman has caused a social media storm after bearing her boobs .\nThe Port Pirie woman showed her size-K assets on Google Street View .\nShe has been called a 'bad mother' by people from her town .\nKaren Davis says they are 'not happy with their own bodies'\nShe plans to do a topless skydive for her 40th birthday next year .", "trunc_input": "A woman has sparked uproar on social media after enthusiastically bearing her K-cup breasts on Google Street View.

{"raw_input": "The White House, the State Department and Democrats on Capitol Hill are side-stepping questions about Hillary Clinton as the controversy over her cyber hygiene escalates. While some of the presumed presidential candidate's party members have come to her defense, many lawmakers headed for the exits this week as reporters asked them for their opinion on the way Clinton handled her email while at the State Department. Democratic strategists were more willing discuss the scandal - but what they had to say, Clinton probably won't like. Democrats are running for cover this week as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton takes fire from the press for over her cyber hygiene. Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business . Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business until Congress reopened an investigation into the Benghazi attack. According to the Associated Press, it was the White House counsel's office that ordered the State Department to retrieve Clinton's old emails. That version of events was never relayed to the press at large, despite the fact that President Barack Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest spent the better part of his briefings with reporters on Tuesday and Wednesday answering questions about what the White House knew about Clinton's exclusive use of her personal email address, when it knew it, and a host of other related inquires. He deflected as often as possible and referred press to the State Department and Clinton. Earnest did note that Clinton's detractors and government watchdogs haven't provided 'any evidence' that would indicate that the former administration official and her team are 'not being forthright' about turning in copies of all of her email communications from her four years in the president's cabinet. His comments were hardly a ringing endorsement of Clinton's honesty, however. The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps. A large-scale, public Q and A session isn't likely to make Friday's schedule, either, as the president is travelling to South Carolina for an event at Benedict College. Usually a spokesperson for the president holds a small gaggle with press riding Air Force One on those days. Unwilling or unable to say who in at the State Department was responsible for making sure Clinton fully complied with the demand, the deputy spokesman there, Marie Harf, directed journalists to the former secretary of state. Pressed to declare that she was 'confident' that all of Clinton's pertinent emails were now in the possession of the federal government she said, 'what I’m saying is her staff has stated that anything related to her work has been given to the State Department.' 'But this is obviously a confirmation her staff has to make,' she added, after a reporter asked if she has any 'reason to doubt' the veracity of Clinton's claims. She said she did not. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent.'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions.' Clinton is pictured here in 2008 taking questions from the press during the Democratic National Convention a few months before she was sworn in as Secretary of State . Clinton's former colleagues in Congress were won't to discuss the issue at all. 'Can we talk about it later? I have to go to my vote,' Clinton's successor in the Senate, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, told the National Journal. The news publication said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, normally outspoken, excused herself for the same reason. 'I don't know enough about it to appropriately respond,' New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said. Congressional Democrats were equally reticent to comment to CNN. 'I'm not up to speed on it. I'm really not,' Montana Sen. Jon Tester told the network on Wednesday - more than a day after story broke. 'Check back,' Tester, the chair of Senate Democrats' campaign arm, said. North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp also asked for a mulligan. 'I don't know enough about what those rules are, honestly, to comment,' she claimed. And the list goes on. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin told National Journal he doesn't 'know the facts' but 'it sounds like somebody made a mistake.' 'She's going to have to give an answer to it,' Vermont Rep. Peter Welch told CNN. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on the House's Select Committee on Benghazi, said it's not his job to protect Clinton, his party's possible nominee for president. 'I want to be clear, I am not trying to defend Hillary Clinton,' he said. 'I am trying to defend the truth … we have some things we are going to try and figure out.' If Clinton can't make the email story go away quick enough, she could go from presidential front runner in 2016 to persona non-grata. Supporters of Clintons are shown here in 2008 after she lost that year's nomination to Barack Obama . Retiring California Sen. Barbara Boxer was one of the few Democratic senators to stand by Clinton. 'That's a nothing burger. Total,' she told National Journal. 'There isn't one secretary of State that ever did that because the law didn't change until after she left, so they're making a mountain out of a molehill,' she added. Likewise, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper said he'd 'be surprised if a number of secretaries of State hadn't done that for as long as we've had email.' 'That's all I'm going to say,' he added. New York Rep. Steve Israel blamed Republicans  for the mess and accused them of 'trying to manufacture or amplify crisis or scandal.' 'That's what they do here,' he told CNN. 'Pretty soon we'll have a special investigative committee for every action that Hillary Clinton takes. There will be a special select committee on her breakfast, her lunch and her dinner and what she had in between. Just add this to the list.' It is true that Clinton's predecessors also used their personal email addresses to conduct official business. But other secretaries of state did not create private email addresses the day before their confirmation votes for the explicit purpose of communicating with their future staff. Nor did they house their email addresses on a privately owned server that is inaccessible to the government and can be wiped clean at their leisure. They weren't actively considering a bid for president, either. Reporters showered White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest with questions on Wednesday about the Clinton email controversy. The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps . Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent. 'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions,' Axelrod said on MSNBC's The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell, according to The Hill. 'Why did she used a separate email? How did she secure that email? Was there another email through which she communicated with people?' he asked. 'By not answering these questions, they are allowing this story to fester in ways that are unhelpful. So lack of speed kills in this case,' the former White House official said. The State Department has said that Clinton had just one email address during her tenure there - the account in question. And Clinton, first through a spokesman, and then through Twitter has touched on the issue. She has not explained why she did what she did, though, or responded to any of the other questions Axelrod - and the media - put forward. A Democratic strategist who spoke to The Hill warned that if Clinton can't make the story go away quick enough, she could go from presidential front runner to persona non-grata. 'We’re probably a month or so away [from the campaign launch] and if this is not handled really well within the next three to six weeks, you’re going to see chatter among Democratic operatives saying, \"Maybe we need another person in this race.\" And that is really problematic.'

Earlier this week Mourinho had hit out at both Souness and Carragher after the defeat to PSG on away goals. Every outfield Chelsea player except Oscar was involved in the mass protest during the PSG game .

{"raw_input": "A detailed search for Indian Ocean rubbish on the south west coast of Tasmania might have indicated that the hunt for missing flight MH370 is in the wrong place. Volunteers have scoured beaches, rocks and shallow waters along a 60-mile stretch of coast in the lower corner of the island state, located to the south of the Australian continent, picking up no less than 80,000 pieces of rubbish. Some of the debris has drifted 6,000 miles across the Indian Ocean from as far away as Madagascar and South Africa but there has been nothing that appears to be from the Malaysia Airlines jet. Yet the official search area for the aircraft, some 1200 miles south west of Perth in Western Australia, lies virtually in the path that the rubbish from the other side of the ocean has drifted along. Doomed: A detailed search for Indian Ocean rubbish on the south west coast of Tasmania might have indicated that the hunt for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 (pictured) is in the wrong place . If nothing more, the discovery of rubbish from Madagascar and South Africa confirms that the ocean tides will carry debris many thousands of miles, passing close to the MH370 search area, to the shores of Australia - and perhaps onwards into the Pacific Ocean. There have been numerous suggestions that despite complex mathematical calculations the search for the aircraft, which vanished more than a year ago on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew, is in the wrong area. And while the rubbish clean-up by a team of volunteers along the remote beaches of Tasmania was not conducted to look for debris from the aircraft, the ocean currents have brought nothing in to suggest that the aircraft lies at the bottom of the sea somewhere out to the west. If there was anything in southern Tasmania from the jet, the team would have found it, for they have been picking up minute pieces of plastic as small as a grain of rice. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported today that 27 people spent eight nights at sea in a fleet of fishing boats, travelling from Low Rocky Point to the mouth of Port Davey in an annual effort to clean the beaches of rubbish floating in from the vast ocean. Tragic: Tourists sign a wall of condolence for the victims of MH370 at Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur airport . In late January, Malaysia's government formally declared the plane's disappearance an accident and said all those on board were presumed dead. Pictured is a screen at the departure hall of Kuala Lumpur airport . No-one reported finding anything that suggested discovered debris was from the jet - but they uncover a great deal of other items that could be traced back to boats and even to Madagascar and the African continent. ‘We found a roll of tape from Madagascar that’s from a vanilla bean manufacturer,’ said expedition leader Matt Dell. ‘We found a bit of stuff from Africa washing around. We found a drift card from Durban (South Africa) that’s like a fish tag - oh, and a set of dolls’ plastic shoes.’ Mr Dell said the volunteers had been visiting the beaches for a number of years ‘and we’re slowly willowing out that big stuff and now all that’s left is the big stuff what washed up between our visits and the small stuff below the sand.’ Most of the rubbish has come from commercial fishing boats such as ropes, floats and pieces of net, but Mr Dell told the ABC that more and more plastic items like drink bottles had been washed up.

And while the rubbish clean-up by a team of volunteers along the remote beaches of Tasmania was not conducted to look for debris from the aircraft, the ocean currents have brought nothing in to suggest that the aircraft lies at the bottom of the sea somewhere out to the west. If there was anything in southern Tasmania from the jet, the team would have found it, for they have been picking up minute pieces of plastic as small as a grain of rice. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported today that 27 people spent eight nights at sea in a fleet of fishing boats, travelling from Low Rocky Point to the mouth of Port Davey in an annual effort to clean the beaches of rubbish floating in from the vast ocean. Tragic: Tourists sign a wall of condolence for the victims of MH370 at Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur airport . In late January, Malaysia's government formally declared the plane's disappearance an accident and said all those on board were presumed dead. Pictured is a screen at the departure hall of Kuala Lumpur airport . No-one reported finding anything that suggested discovered debris was from the jet - but they uncover a great deal of other items that could be traced back to boats and even to Madagascar and the African continent. ‘We found a roll of tape from Madagascar that’s from a vanilla bean manufacturer,’ said expedition leader Matt Dell. ‘We found a bit of stuff from Africa washing around. We found a drift card from Durban (South Africa) that’s like a fish tag - oh, and a set of dolls’ plastic shoes.’ Mr Dell said the volunteers had been visiting the beaches for a number of years ‘and we’re slowly willowing out that big stuff and now all that’s left is the big stuff what washed up between our visits and the small stuff below the sand.’ Most of the rubbish has come from commercial fishing boats such as ropes, floats and pieces of net, but Mr Dell told the ABC that more and more plastic items like drink bottles had been washed up. But so far, nothing from MH370. It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing.

{"raw_input": "Nestled in the Somerset countryside and protected by soundproof fencing, neighbours say it looks like a holiday park. But this £1.6million caravan site has been built by a council to provide a permanent home for just eight traveller families. The facility, Carrswood View, is on the site of a previous unauthorised and run-down camp near Bath. Bath's first permanent gipsy camp, which cost £1.6million to build, is due to open next month and contains eight permanent pitches . The site contains eight permanent pitches and five which are designated 'transit' sites for people who are just passing through the area . Each of the pitches have been built to house a utility unit, which contains washing facilities (left) and space for furniture (right) Retired engineer Michael Parr, 69, said: ‘It’s a lot of money to lavish on people who travel around. It’s like a holiday camp.’ Another local said: ‘Don’t think I’ll bother paying to go to Center Parcs or Butlins any more!’ The site has five ‘transit’ pitches for short stays and eight permanent plots with a living room, sanitary facilities, a patio and parking for two caravans and two cars. Because it is in the green belt, the units are clad in wood with grass roofs so they blend in. Soundproof fencing will cut down noise from a nearby road and railway. The build, by Elim Housing, cost £1.62million – with £870,000 of council cash and £750,000 from central government. Allan Perrin, 64, has lived nearby for 25 years. He said: ‘It is a vast improvement but the question is could it have been done cheaper?’ Carrswood View has been developed on the site of an illegal encampment in Bath which had become run-down and full of rubbish . The illegal site was full of discarded rubbish and gas canisters, and councillors hope the new development will give them more control . Each utility unit has been built in wood and have a roof which will be covered in grass to minimise the impact of the green belt development . Tim Warren, of the opposition Tory group on Bath and North East Somerset Council, said: ‘It’s absolutely beautiful, however, is this the best use of taxpayers’ money? I’m also not convinced this is the final figure. When we first had meetings around this, costs were estimated at over £2million.’ Gypsy Council chairman Joseph P Jones said it was a lot to spend – and it would have been cheaper to let the travellers build their own housing. He said: ‘The majority of new provision comes from the gipsy and traveller community itself, and because it is built by us and owned by us, it costs the council nothing and is generally better looked after.’ Residents of Carrswood View will pay £105 a week rent and £963.40 a year council tax, with 11 applicants hoping to move in next month. Council leader Paul Crossley said having a dedicated gipsy site made it easier to clear illegal camps. The council is in the process of making £30million of cuts over three years. The utility unit for each pitch contains sinks, electricity points and running water, as well as room for kitchen equipment to be installed . Finishing touches are being made to fences and driveways for each of the pitches, to give the maximum possible facilities for families .

{"raw_input": "There are two players in the post-Tiger Woods era who have left Graeme McDowell feeling utterly helpless and wondering how on earth he can compete. One, of course, is his old friend Rory McIlroy. And the other is Dustin Johnson. As it turned out, McDowell, like everyone else, didn’t have to worry about beating the American because he was too busy beating himself. Johnson vehemently denies a failed test for recreational drugs use prompted him to take a six-month leave of absence that caused him to miss the Ryder Cup last year. Whether that is true or not, there were plenty of other party-style vices he did own up to that needed addressing and were enough by themselves to turn an obvious world top-three player into one struggling to stay in the top 20. American Dustin Johnson (left) won the WGC Cadillac Championship on Sunday . Graeme McDowell hits onto the 18th green after his ball landed near a tree at the WGC Cadillac Championship . McDowell holds Johnson in the same regard as fellow Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy . Johnson shows off his awesome power off the tee with another brutal drive at Doral . Johnson stands 6ft 4in and is such a naturally talented athlete he had every sporting coach at his college clamouring for him to specialise in their particular pursuit. When he started making millions from golf, it was hardly surprising that temptation lay at every turn. Only Adam Scott attracted more swooning women than Johnson, but only Scott was wise enough to pick his way through the pitfalls. And now Johnson’s back. Will this turn out like another John Daly fable, where he returns but only to fall back into his old ways as quick as a lead can disappear on a pressure-filled Sunday? Happily, all the signs point the other way. During the break, his fiancee Paulina Gretzky — whose ice hockey-playing father Wayne holds the same revered status in Canada that Kenny Dalglish holds in Liverpool — gave birth to their first child. When Johnson starting practising ahead of his return, his coach Butch Harmon couldn’t believe the difference mentally. Johnson's happy family life with Paulina Gretzky (left) could spell trouble for McIlroy (right) on the course . Johnson's form has been stunning since he became a father. Gretzky gave birth to son, Tatum, in January . Gretzky and Johnson share a kiss, while Tatum watches, after his victory in Miami on Sunday . It’s showing on the golf course. Heck, he’s only played five events following that long break and he’s already had two second-place finishes and, on Sunday, a classy win in the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral. How’s that for talent? It was all on show on the 18th hole on Sunday. The water hazard that juts out at 300 yards to the edge of the fairway and caught even McIlroy’s drive? Johnson cleared it comfortably. McIlroy hit a three-iron for his third shot; Johnson had an eight-iron. It was the eighth consecutive season in which Johnson has managed at least one victory. The next best sequence on the PGA Tour is Justin Rose’s five. Johnson was handed the Gene Sarazen Cup by Donald Trump after his victory at the weekend . Johnson pictured putting on the sixth hole during his final round in Florida on Sunday . Johnson insists that his six-month absence from golf was not down to a failed drugs test . Just like the Northern Irishman, his game is built on devastating power and accuracy from the tee. Now 30, he has given McIlroy an enormous head start. Imagine the pair coming down the stretch at a major with one man having four Grand Slam wins to draw upon while the other is still awaiting his first? But if you’re looking for the player who ought to run McIlroy the closest over the next few years, Johnson has the game. And now — finally — it looks like he might also have the brain. ‘I can hardly believe I’ve played a tournament without a single bogey. I didn’t think it was possible on this course.’ It was a good job it was possible for the impressive Korean Inbee Park, for it’s about the only way any of the women can beat 17-year-old Lydia Ko these days. Inbee Park (left) won the Women's Championship trophy in Singapore by two shots over Lydia Ko . Park (second right) won the tournament by not firing a single bogey across the four rounds . Ko, wh became golf's youngest-ever world No 1 last month, finished the event in second place . Even so, 26-year-old Park still only won the HSBC Women’s Champions tournament in Singapore by two shots from the New Zealander, who has two wins and now this second place to her name since becoming golf’s youngest-ever world No 1 last month. Sections of the American press are wondering why Rory McIlroy was given a largely free pass for tossing his three-iron into the water last week while the criticism that would have followed Tiger Woods, if he’d done it, ‘would have blown up the internet’. So let’s see if we can explain the difference. At the age of 25 Woods never engaged with spectators, rarely signed autographs, was frequently seen spitting on the side of greens and treated the press with barely concealed contempt. McIlroy acknowledges the crowds, devotes hours of his time to signing autographs and spends way longer than he needs trying to give an insight to the media. Reap what you sow, it’s called. American media has queried if Tiger Woods would have got more stick than McIlroy for throwing a club away . McIlroy threw his three-iron into the lake in Florida but a scuba diver later discovered it . It is not known whether Woods (right) will compete at the Masters at Augusta next month . As for whether Tiger will be back for the Masters next month there is, of course, no word. No update on his progress, nothing. To turn the question around: could you ever imagine McIlroy acting like that? The only thing we can say with a degree of certainty is that Friday is surely a big day if Woods is to turn up at Augusta. That’s the deadline for entering the Arnold Palmer Invitational next week — and if he doesn’t play in that event, one he’s won a remarkable eight times, it’s hard to envisage him playing the Masters.", "raw_output": "Dustin Johnson had a six-month leave of absence from golf .\nHe fiercely rejected rumours it was because of a failed drugs test .\nHe won the WGC Cadillac Championship in Florida on Sunday .", "trunc_input": "There are two players in the post-Tiger Woods era who have left Graeme McDowell feeling utterly helpless and wondering how on earth he can compete.

Grisly accident: A window washer was leaning out of a fifth-floor unit at the Hanover River House at 335 Greenwich Street in Tribeca when fell, landing with his head in a pile of snow and his body on the sidewalk . Horrified witnesses said the victim was still breathing and conscious by the time first responders came on the scene. As they were awaiting the paramedics’ arrival, several Good Samaritans walked over and covered the man with their coats to keep him warm against the frigid temperatures, according to the New York Post. Responding EMTs performed chest compressions on the injured worker and then rushed him to New York Downtown Hospital, where he died a short time later. 7Online reported that the window the man was washing was unhinged and swung open, causing him to fall out to his death. Witness Orie Cipollaro described the 38-year-old worker hanging out of the window backwards in the minutes before the deadly fall, while another bystander claimed he saw the man hold onto the window with one hand while washing it with the other, reported the New York Daily News. In an interview with the News, witness John Cataneo described a grisly scene on Greenwich Street this afternoon. ‘His legs were twisted his arms were bent and he was bleeding from his hands, it was very gruesome,’ Cataneo recalled. Employer: The deceased window washer worked for Aerial Window Cleaning, headquarterd in this building at 260 West 36th Street .

{"raw_input": "Technology now in use by the New York Police Department may be picking up stray conversations. Three hundred ShotSpotter microphones are being placed in high crime areas of the Bronx and Brooklyn, with the aim of alerting police immediately when they overhear the sound of gunshots. However, the devices pick up more that just the bang of shots being fired in potential crimes, and evidence from conversations they've listened in on has been used in court. Scroll down for video . New York City's pilot program using ShotSpotter's microphone technology began last week in the Bronx. Above, Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks about the system . The ShotSpotter system works by sending a few seconds of audio to police departments along with location information after a potential gunshot system makes it through a filtering process . Audio recordings from ShotSpotter have been used to corroborate testimony that led to convictions in a 2011 Massachusetts murder where a voice was heard shouting 'No Jason, no Jason!' before shots were fired. NYPD officials and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a pilot program for the microphones earlier this week. Sensors in seven districts of the Bronx have already begun working, and the devices will be turned on in ten districts of Brooklyn on Monday, according to the New York Times. 'This gunshot detection system is going to do a world of good in terms of going after the bad guys,' de Blasio said. The devices are thought to help police respond more quickly and help authorities pin point the exact location of shootings after potential gunshot recordings are sent through the company's headquarters in California. ShotSpotter says that its devices 'are specifically designed to be triggered by loud explosive or 'impuslive' sounds only.' Three microphones must be triggered to start an alert and triangulate a location. The company says that human voices, slamming car doors and loud music will not trigger the microphones, which then send summary data about a sound to the company. The ShotSpotter system (above) filters out noises such as car door slams and yelling before sending alerts to the police . Recordings of a human voice captured by the ShotSpotter system were used to get a conviction in a Massachusetts murder case . It states that there is no 'live streaming' of any microphones apart from the few seconds of regular audio sent to its employees for further analysis about whether the sound may have been a firecracker or a gunshot. An alert, location data and a few seconds of audio are then sent to local police. The restrictions on triggering events have not stopped some privacy advocates from saying that evidence procured by the ShotSpotters may violate the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. 'If [ShotSpotter] is recording voices out in public, it needs to be shut down,' the ACLU's Jay Stanley told Take Part. He said his organization is 'always concerned about secondary uses of technology that is sold to us for some unobjectionable purpose and is then used for other purposes.' De Blasio has adopted a two-year pilot program for $1.5million after ShotSpotter was used in other US cities such as Washington and San Francisco . Concerns have also been raised about the intrusiveness of audio recording being combined with surveillance video, according to the South Coast Today. ShotSpotter's website said that '3 out of approximately 3 million incidents' have been latched onto by 'privacy zealots' and that the voices in those cases were yelling loudly in a public street during a shooting rather than having a private conversation. The company's technology is already being used in major cities such as Washington, Boston, Oakland, San Francisco and Minneapolis. Its use has revealed that the vast majority of verified gunshots it picks up are never reported to police. However, it has also been accused of wasting police resources. Seventy-five per cent of the alerts issued in Newark, New Jersey, were false alarm, according to WNYC. The two-year New York pilot program for ShotSpotter will cost $1.5million. Sensors are often placed on buildings and poles.", "raw_output": "ShotSpotter microphones detect gunshots and triangulate location .\nTechnology uses filtering process to eliminate car door slams and yelling .\nSnippet of a sound was used to get Massachusetts murder conviction .\nCompany says no private conversations are being monitored by its system .\nNew York City is beginning pilot program for $1.5million .", "trunc_input": "Technology now in use by the New York Police Department may be picking up stray conversations.

He said his organization is 'always concerned about secondary uses of technology that is sold to us for some unobjectionable purpose and is then used for other purposes.' De Blasio has adopted a two-year pilot program for $1.5million after ShotSpotter was used in other US cities such as Washington and San Francisco . Concerns have also been raised about the intrusiveness of audio recording being combined with surveillance video, according to the South Coast Today. ShotSpotter's website said that '3 out of approximately 3 million incidents' have been latched onto by 'privacy zealots' and that the voices in those cases were yelling loudly in a public street during a shooting rather than having a private conversation. The company's technology is already being used in major cities such as Washington, Boston, Oakland, San Francisco and Minneapolis. Its use has revealed that the vast majority of verified gunshots it picks up are never reported to police. However, it has also been accused of wasting police resources. Seventy-five per cent of the alerts issued in Newark, New Jersey, were false alarm, according to WNYC. The two-year New York pilot program for ShotSpotter will cost $1.5million. Sensors are often placed on buildings and poles.", "trunc_output": "ShotSpotter microphones detect gunshots and triangulate location .\nTechnology uses filtering process to eliminate car door slams

Minister Renzi over reform of Italy's voting system and . political apparatus, complaining that Renzi had excluded him . from the choice of who should become the new head of state. On Tuesday Forza Italia voted against Renzi's political . reforms in the Chamber of Deputies, but 18 party deputies wrote . a public letter of dissent. They lamented a lack of internal . party democracy and said they had only obeyed Berlusconi's . instructions out of loyalty to their leader. Forza Italia has steadily lost support since Berlusconi was . convicted for tax fraud in 2013. As a result of that sentence he . lost his seat in the Senate and was barred from holding any . public office. According to most polls the party now has only 13 to 14 per cent . of the vote. That puts it behind Renzi's Democratic Party, the . anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the anti-immigrant .

{"raw_input": "The captivating motion of various satellites orbiting our planet has been revealed in a fascinating Nasa video. Created by the agency’s Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland, it shows their entire Earth-observation fleet and the paths they take around Earth. While the ISS sweeps across ‘diagonally’, in the video at least, others like the Landsat series are seen travelling from pole to pole. Scroll down for video . Nasa scientists in Maryland, US have created a satellite visualisation (shown). It shows dozens of Earth-observing satellites currently orbiting our planet. They include Landsat 7 and 8, part of Nasa's long-serving series. And the ISS can also be seen sweeping diagonally across Earth . The animation solely shows Nasa's Earth-observing satellites, and not any run by other space agencies or private organisations. The satellites measure rainfall, solar irradiance, clouds, sea surface height, ocean salinity and other aspects of the global environment. ‘Together, they provide a picture of the Earth as a system,’ said Nasa. The animation shows the day of 16 February 2015 from 00.00 GMT to 12.00 GMT. While the satellites might look close together, the amount of space in Earth orbit is vast, and there is little to no chance of any colliding. In fact, they are all placed on specific orbits within their orbital bands that ensure the minimal chance possible of colliding with another satellite. This doesn't always go to plan, though. In 2009, a US Iridium satellite and a defunct Russian Cosmos satellite collided, creating hundreds of new pieces of debris in orbit. But the precision of modern satellites is best seen by a quartet of satellites known as the ‘A-train’ - Aqua, Aura, CloudSat and Calipso - which follow each other closely in their orbits. The two closest, Cloudsat and Calipso, are just 12.5 seconds apart, but this equates to 58 miles (93km) in distance. The four satellites work together to provide even better observations of Earth. ‘It’s acting like one satellite with 15 instruments onboard,’ Ernie Wright, an animator at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre, told Wired, referring to the 15 instruments shared between them. The Landsat series of satellites have, since 1972, been used to measure Earth’s continental and coastal landscapes at a scale where human impacts and natural changes can be monitored. Shown is an illustration of Landsat 8, which launched on 11 February 2013 . Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. Some satellites, like Landsat 7 and 8, orbit from pole to pole, known as a polar orbit. This allows them to see almost the entirety of Earth as the globe rotates underneath them. The Landsat series of satellites have, since 1972, been used to measure Earth’s continental and coastal landscapes at a scale where human impacts and natural changes can be monitored. The ISS, meanwhile, has a diagonal orbit that keeps it relatively near the equator, which enables various command centres across the world to stay in contact with the crew. Recently launched satellites on the animation include the Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission, which measures the surface soil moisture on Earth, and was launched on 31 January 2015. A full list of the satellites and their missions is available at Nasa’s Scientific Visualisation Studio website.

Her fellow accused include the likes of Beyonce, Kim Kardashian and home grown supermodel Miranda Kerr, all of whom have come under fire for appearing to tweak their pictures. Scroll down for video . Hashtag no filter? Miranda Kerr is among a host of stars accused of using photo editing tools to appear slimmer in her Instagram pictures . Spot the difference: Miranda raised eyebrows by posting a picture in 2013 on Instagram (right) which was a slimmed-down version of the original (left), taken at the 2012 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show . While many Instagram users are guilty of adding a flattering filter to their selfies, it seems the stars are taking it a step further, and using photo editing tools to appear thinner. Miranda Kerr has twice been accused of needlessly slimming down her waist in pictures posted to her Instagram account. In 2013 the supermodel attended a Michael Kors event in Japan wearing a cut-out gown, but raised eyebrows when she uploaded a picture in which her already slender waist appeared noticeably smaller. Real life vs Instagram: TV presenter Laura Csortan has been repeatedly accused of tampering with her images to make her already incredible figure appear smaller . Tell-tale signs: A number of Csortan's Instagram snaps show evidence of photoshop including a blurry background . Not quite right: This picture shows Laura's waist looking skewed and obviously slimmer than in a duplicate image posted on a friend's account . In another incident, the 31-year-old issued an apology for posting a picture which she claims she did not realise had been photoshopped. Miranda shared a picture of herself with her then fellow Victoria's Secret Angels Doutzen Kroes and . Alessandra Ambrosio backstage at the 2012 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. But some of her 5.5million followers were quick to point out that her waist appeared significantly thinner than in the original photograph. When Kim Kardashian took a trip to the Versace house in March 2014 she faced criticism for the picture on the right, in which she appeared to have slimmed her waist and hips . British reality star Lauren Goodger has been accused of smoothing her waist to appear thinner, as shown in this picture posted when she attended the Clothes Show last year . After making headlines around the world and a facing an army of fans questioning why the incredibly slim and fit star would need to photoshop her body, Miranda said in a statement: 'When I re-posted the photo this week to support the girls I screen grabbed it off the internet when I was working in Japan. I had no idea it was Photoshopped.' For her part, Laura Csortan has flat-out denied slimming down her body in her Instagram pictures, despite obvious signs of tweaking such as blurring and skewed lines appearing in the snaps. She has previously told Daily Mail Australia she uses filters, Instagram settings and occasionally a blemish remover app. Beyonce is no stranger to  controversy, she has previously been accused of slimming down her pictures and in this snap, taken whilst she was holidaying in the South of France, it looked like her waist was slimmer . These two photos were taken just two days apart whilst Geordie Shore personality Charlotte Crosby holidayed in Perth in February, in the picture on the left she looks rounder than she does in her Instagram snap . Lauren appears to be a fan of heavy filtering, as shown in the softened selfie on the right . 'Apart from using the filters on Instagram, I have never altered any of my pictures,' she has said. British reality stars such as Charlotte Crosby and Lauren Goodger have previously posted pictures to the social networking site where they look considerably smaller than in paparazzi pictures of them taken on the same day. Of course, stars like Beyonce and Kim Kardashian are no strangers to being accused of altering their photographs. When singer Beyonce posted photographs of her summer holiday to Instagram last year she was accused of slimming down both her waist and legs. And when Kim took a trip to the Versace house last year the picture she posted to the social networking site made her look thinner than those taken of her by the photographers waiting outside. They say the camera never lies, but some seem to be telling a few fibs. Here are some more stars that might have been given a helping hand... In these pictures of Britney Spears, which were taken on the same day in November, she looks considerably slimmed down in the picture on the right which was posted to her Instagram . Holly Hagan has lost a lot of weight over the last year, however, she looked like her waist was slimmer in this picture posted to Instagram (right) around the same time that she attended the NTAs (left) Jennifer Lopez has beautiful skin already but it looks as though she used a filer to make it completely flawless in this picture taken as she promoted The Box Next Door in January .", "raw_output": "Miranda, Laura, Kim K and Britney appear thinner in Instagram snaps .\nSome of them have been accused of editing their photographs .\nBeyonce has previously been accused of slimming down her body .", "trunc_input": "TV presenter Laura Csortan has been ridiculed for her alleged penchant for photoshopping Instagram snaps.

When Kim Kardashian took a trip to the Versace house in March 2014 she faced criticism for the picture on the right, in which she appeared to have slimmed her waist and hips . British reality star Lauren Goodger has been accused of smoothing her waist to appear thinner, as shown in this picture posted when she attended the Clothes Show last year . After making headlines around the world and a facing an army of fans questioning why the incredibly slim and fit star would need to photoshop her body, Miranda said in a statement: 'When I re-posted the photo this week to support the girls I screen grabbed it off the internet when I was working in Japan. I had no idea it was Photoshopped.' For her part, Laura Csortan has flat-out denied slimming down her body in her Instagram pictures, despite obvious signs of tweaking such as blurring and skewed lines appearing in the snaps. She has previously told Daily Mail Australia she uses filters, Instagram settings and occasionally a blemish remover app. Beyonce is no stranger to  controversy, she has previously been accused of slimming down her pictures and in this snap, taken whilst she was holidaying in the South of France, it looked like her waist was slimmer . These two photos were taken just two days apart whilst Geordie Shore personality Charlotte Crosby holidayed in Perth in February, in the picture on the left she looks rounder than she does in her Instagram snap . Lauren appears to be a fan of heavy filtering, as shown in the softened selfie on the right . 'Apart from using the filters on Instagram, I have never altered any of my pictures,' she has said. British reality stars such as Charlotte Crosby and Lauren Goodger have previously posted pictures to the social networking site where they look considerably smaller than in paparazzi pictures of them taken on the same day. Of course, stars like Beyonce and Kim Kardashian are no strangers to being accused of altering their photographs. When singer Beyonce posted photographs of her summer holiday to Instagram last year she was accused of slimming down both her waist and legs. And when Kim took a trip to the Versace house last year the picture she posted to the social networking site made her look thinner than those taken of her by the photographers waiting outside. They say the camera never lies, but some seem to be telling a few fibs. Here are some more stars that might have been given a helping hand... In these pictures of Britney Spears, which were taken on the same day in November, she looks considerably slimmed down in the picture on the right which was posted to her Instagram . Holly Hagan has lost a lot of weight over the last year, however, she looked like her waist was slimmer in this picture posted to Instagram (right) around the same time that she attended the NTAs (left) Jennifer Lopez has beautiful skin already but it looks as though she used a filer to make it completely flawless in this picture taken as she promoted The Box Next Door in January .",

{"raw_input": "World Cup winners Germany will be at their best when they take on Euro 2016 qualifying rivals Poland, Scotland and Ireland  after their current period of experimentation, insists Joachim Low. The Germans drew 2-2 in a friendly against Asian champions Australia on Wednesday before a 2-0 victory at Georgia in a Euro qualifier on Sunday. While easing past the Georgians to stay on track for qualification, Germany missed a string of chances again as they struggled with their finishing. Joachim Low's side have failed to replicate the form previously shown at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Germany playmaker Mario Gotze (right) wastes a golden chance against Georgia by shooting wide . Low, who has extended his contract recently to 2018, has said he wants to tinker with his team that won the World Cup last year to make it more flexible and adaptable to different opponents. A three-man defence and more attacking full backs have been two of his experiments, with the coach also trying to find a good mix of youth and experience after the departure of three key players following the World Cup and the return of several long-term absentees, including Marco Reus, Ilkay Guendogan and Holger Badstuber. He has also announced more young players will be in his squad from September onwards. 'We now have a test in the summer against the United States and there I can still try some things out,' Low said of their June 10 friendly before they face Gibraltar in a qualifier three days later. 'After that our forces will then be very focused for our games in September, October and November.'

'In the second half of the year we are always better.' While Germany are expected to qualify for the tournament in France, Low is delighted to have Reus back and in goalscoring form following a string of injuries last year, with the speedy winger on target in both games.

{"raw_input": "The Tunisian ministry released a picture on its Facebook page which reportedly shows the leader of Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade Lokmane Abou Sakhr . A gunman who is suspected of being involved in the terror attack on foreign tourists at a Tunisian museum is believed to have been killed in an armed raid. Prime Minister Habib Essid has told state news agency TAP that Khaled Chaieb, also known as Abou Sakhr Lokman, was killed overnight in an operation in the Gafsa region near the Algerian border. Chaieb is believed to be a prominent militant in al-Qaida's North African arm and is described as one of Tunisia's 'most dangerous terrorists.' He was one of nine armed militants killed in an operation on Saturday evening. Chaieb is suspected of leading or helping lead the March 18 attack on the National Bardo Museum which saw 21 people, mostly foreign tourists gunned down. Police killed two of the gunmen who are said to be Tunisians in their 20s, who had trained in Libya. Security officials have claimed the militants were members of the Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade, a jihadist group. Authorities have arrested several people in connection with the attack - dubbed the worst in Tunisia in 13 years. CCTV footage of the shooting shows the gunmen roaming free around the museum. The lack of security at the country's largest museum has since been called into question. The news comes as tens of thousands of Tunisians marched through the capital Tunis in a solidarity protest today. French President Francois Hollande confirmed yesterday that Huguette Dupeu had died from her injuries following the attack. Mr Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and several foreign ministers and officials from other countries are joining an anti-terrorism ceremony in Tunis after the march. The Tunisian government called on all major political parties to join the march from the seat of government at Bab Es-Saadoun to the museum. News of Sakhr's death was announced as tens of thousands of people marched through Tunisia . People from the World Social Forum gathered today to denounce terror attacks in the capital Tunis . The international visitors are showing solidarity with Tunisia, whose fragile new democracy was deeply shaken by the museum attack, for which ISIS claimed responsibility. Fighters from Tunisia make up a disproportionately high number of foreign recruits to ISIS in Syria, with as many as 10,000 having signed up. ISIS issued a statement and audio on jihadi websites applauding the dead gunmen as 'knights' for their 'blessed invasion of one of the dens of infidels and vice in Muslim Tunisia'. CCTV images shows the terrorist attack on the National Bardo Museum in Tunisia earlier this month . Tunisian protesters took to the streets across the region following the attack. Authorities are struggling with scattered extremist violence linked to various radical Islamic groups, largely linked to neighboring countries Algeria or Libya. Interior Ministry spokesman Ali Aroui said Sunday that nine suspected \"terrorists\" were killed when security forces clashed with the suspects in the southwest region of Sidi Aich, near the Algerian border. He said several extremists were wounded in another clash in the northwest region of Kef, as part of security operations around the country ahead of the march.", "raw_output": "Gunmen killed 21 people in attack on National Bardo Museum in Tunisia .\nTwo were killed by police and third is now believed to have been killed .\nAbou Sakhr Lokman is one of nine people killed in overnight armed raid .\nHe is believed to have been involved in museum terror attack that saw foreign tourists killed and was one of Tunisia's 'most dangerous terrorists'", "trunc_input": "The Tunisian ministry released a picture on its Facebook page which reportedly shows the leader of Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade Lokmane Abou Sakhr .

{"raw_input": "(CNN)For four years, William Bruce James II called the University of Oklahoma's Sigma Alpha Epsilon his home. He walked its halls, bunked in its rooms, held office as one of its leaders, considered his fraternity brothers his dearest friends. He was proud to be SAE. Now that pride is tainted. A video shot this Saturday of party-bound shows SAE members clapping, pumping their fists and chanting in unison: \"There will never be a ni**** SAE,\" they sing. \"You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me.\" These young men are talking about him, James said. That's because not only is he an SAE alumni, he is also African-American. How do you make sense of the fact that those behind these hateful words wore the same pledge pins, occupied the same house, preached \"the same motto that I hold dear to my heart\" as James did? \"I couldn't look at myself,\" he said, \"still claiming to be that.\" Since the video surfaced Sunday, students have been expelled and SAE's Oklahoma chapter has shut down. The episode has left James disgusted, horrified that members of a fraternity that once welcomed him could espouse such hatred. Students expelled over racist chant . \"I don't know what happened to the culture of my home,\" he told CNN on Tuesday. \"That is not my home. That is not SAE. They are not my brothers.\" While the Oklahoma frat has never had a lot of black members, that didn't matter to James when he joined in 2001. SAE was where he forged lifelong friendships, where he and others grew into men. \"We were becoming something while I was there,\" he said. \"Something that I don't think these kids grasped. ... I don't think they know what it means to be a brother of any fraternity, let alone mine.\" James doesn't believe the racist chant was an isolated incident, not given how many on the bus seemingly sang it so easily and enthusiastically. Nor does he think that only those leading the chant deserve punishment. Just as easily as one person could have started it, someone else could have called for it to stop. That's what James thinks that his own fraternity brothers would've done, whether he was around or not. They understood the importance of stepping up to say: \"This isn't right, this isn't what I stand for, this isn't gentlemanly, this isn't even human,\" he said. \"That's what being an SAE is.\" \"My pledge class ... wouldn't let that happen,\"  he said. \"And I don't know what's happened to (the Oklahoma SAE chapter) since then.\" Many members of that pledge class, as well others who he knew from SAE, have reached out to James in recent days by text, phone, email and Facebook. He knows he is not alone, including in his support for disbanding Oklahoma's SAE chapter. \"That entire house has accepted the culture that accepts that song, those words, that imagery,\" James said. \"So the whole house has to be punished.\" His former frat brothers are different from him, of course. Their skin color wouldn't have stopped them from getting into SAE if the twisted chant reflected reality. Still, James feels their pain is real and sincere. Those on this weekend's video may not be his brothers, but those he knew from 2001 to 2005 still are. \"I don't think that they can fully encompass the pain and betrayal that I feel,\" James said of his white friends from the fraternity. \"But by holding me so close in their life, they know that their brother was hurt.\" \"So it's a thing they're feeling in their family.

{"raw_input": "Two more women have come forward to accused Bill Cosby of drugging and raping them in their youth. Margie Shapiro and Sunni Welles both claim they were 17-years-old when, after a night out with Cosby, they woke up and realized they had been sexually assaulted. What's more, Welles was a lifelong family friend of the embattled comedian. Scroll down for videos . Sunni Welles (left) and Margie Shapiro (right) have come forward to claim they were raped by Bill Cosby when they were both 17-years-old . Over 30 women have come forward since last October claiming they were sexually assaulted by Cosby (above), who has repeatedly denied all their claims . The two women detailed their experiences in a press conference with lawyer Gloria Allred on Friday afternoon that was covered by The Wrap. Shapiro claims that she and Cosby met in 1975 when she worked at a doughnut shop in Santa Monica that the actor would frequent, and that he invited her to visit him on the set of the film he was working on at the time. From there he invited her to a dinner, but it was cancelled so he took her to the Playboy Mansion. Once there she says the two entered a 'game house' and began playing pinball. She said that she was not drinking at the time, but Cosby said whoever lost the game would have to take a pill, which she admits she agreed to. After losing and taking the pill, she claims she woke up to find that she was naked and Cosby was inside her. She says she passed back out but came to once more and that Cosby was touching her sexually. In the end, he told her she was not dressed well enough to meet Hugh Hefner and she was sent home with a driver. After that, she remembers 'feeling sick' when she saw Cosby's image in her head. Margie Shapiro (in photo at 17 being held up by lawyer Gloria Allred) claims that after meeting Cosby in 1975 at the doughnut shop she worked at, he invited her to visit him on set . Sunni Welles' (left) mother was friends with Cosby in the mid-1960s when she claims he invited her to go to a jazz club, pout something in her drink and then had sex with her . Welles meanwhile had known Cosby for years as her mother worked in Hollywood, first as a theatrical agent and then a story editor, and that as a teenager studying music she was thrilled when Cosby offered to take her to see some jazz back in the mid-1960s. Cosby and her mother had a friendship, so neither mother or daughter thought anything of it, and the experience of seeing live music would be good they thought as Welles was auditioning to be a background singer. Welles, like Shapiro, was not drinking, and ordered a Coke she claims at the club. After she had a sip she says 'things began to become blurry.' The next thing she remembers is waking up in an empty apartment feeling as if she had engaged in sexual intercourse. Cosby was nowhere to be found, so the young woman went home. Now Welles, who called Cosby a 'sexual predator,' is seeing if she might still be able to bring a suit against him. This all comes just days after Chelsea Handler (above with ex Andre Balazs) came forward to reveal that she too believes she might have become one of Cosby's victims . This all comes just days after Chelsea Handler came forward to reveal that she too believes she might have become one of Cosby's victims after he invited her to his hotel room in Atlantic City a few years back.

{"raw_input": "Martin Guptill became the first man to score a double hundred in a Cricket World Cup knockout match and propelled co-hosts New Zealand into the semi-finals as they sealed a 143-run win against West Indies. The 28-year-old batsman was dropped in the first over before going on to score 237 from 163 balls — including 24 fours and 11 sixes, one of which found the roof of Wellington’s Westpac Stadium in the final over. The record-breaking innings — the second highest one-day international score of all time behind Indian Rohit Sharma’s 264 — helped his side to 393-6. Martin Guptill celebrates after scoring his double century during New Zealand's win over the West Indies . ‘I’m still not really sure what happened,’ said Guptill. ‘I am incredibly proud of what we achieved today and hopefully moving forward we can win another game and then another one after that.’ The fact Guptill was the first New Zealander to pass 200 in a ODI was not really a surprise. He scored 189 not out against England in 2013 and said, looking back at that innings, he felt he could have achieved the mark then. ‘I did muck around in the middle overs of that innings but I wouldn’t take it back at all,’ added Guptill. ‘To set the record and then break it again is pretty amazing and I just have to try to do it again I guess.’ The batsman recorded the second highest one-day international score in the sports history with 237 . In reply, West Indies were all out for 250 in 30.3 overs, with Trent Boult claiming four for 44 to become the leading wicket-taker in the tournament. New Zealand will face South Africa in the semi-finals while Australia play India in the other match. It could have been so different, though, had Marlon Samuels held a catch just three balls in which would have sent Guptill back to the pavilion. Guptill also survived two lbw shouts but New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum had less luck at the other end as he fell for 12 runs. Guptill was given a standing ovation following his impressive innings in the World Cup clash .", "raw_output": "Martin Guptill scored an impressive 237 from 163 balls for New Zealand .\nThe co-hosts are through to the semi-finals after beating the West Indies .\nGuptill could have been caught out but was dropped by Marlon Samuels .\nClick here for all the latest Cricket World Cup news .", "trunc_input": "Martin Guptill became the first man to score a double hundred in a Cricket World Cup knockout match and propelled co-hosts New Zealand into the semi-finals as they sealed a 143-run win against West Indies.

He scored 189 not out against England in 2013 and said, looking back at that innings, he felt he could have achieved the mark then. ‘I did muck around in the middle overs of that innings but I wouldn’t take it back at all,’ added Guptill. ‘To set the record and then break it again is pretty amazing and I just have to try to do it again I guess.’ The batsman recorded the second highest one-day international score in the sports history with 237 . In reply, West Indies were all out for 250 in 30.3 overs, with Trent Boult claiming four for 44 to become the leading wicket-taker in the tournament. New Zealand will face South Africa in the semi-finals while Australia play India in the other match. It could have been so different, though, had Marlon Samuels held a catch just three balls in which would have sent Guptill back to the pavilion. Guptill also survived two lbw shouts but New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum had less luck at the other end as he fell for 12 runs. Guptill was given a standing ovation following his impressive innings in the World Cup clash .", "trunc_output": "Martin Guptill scored an impressive 237 from 163 balls for New Zealand .\nThe co-hosts

{"raw_input": "Jennifer K. 'Kaya' Thompson, 44, has now joined 35 other women who have made claims of sexual assault against Bill Cosby . A Bill Cosby accuser, 'Jane Doe No.2', has decided to reveal her identity after finding the strength to finally go public about the alleged attack 30 years ago. Jennifer K. 'Kaya' Thompson has now joined 35 other women who have made claims of sexual assault against the The Cosby Show star. Ms Thompson, a 44-year-old from Florida, told People: 'It's come to my understanding that there's greater credibility for my testimony with a full name and an image. 'I am so very grateful for the Jane Doe who came before me in the lawsuit 10 years ago... My mother and I were very eager to give our support via testimony at that time – however, not to the general public. I was not quite strong enough then.' In 1988, the then 17-year-old aspiring model met Cosby via her modelling agency in New York. He assured the teen and her parents that he would help her become a star. Ms Thompson told People that Cosby made uncomfortable advances against her which ended in her feeling pressured to perform a sexual act on him. 'I'm like a robot, and that is what I became, and that is what I did for him,' she said. She was reportedly given $700 as she left his home. She told People that she had decided to come forward now because she 'would rather go to bed at night knowing that I've been honest'. She also felt that remaining as 'Jane Doe No.2' made her allegations less credible. Ultimately, Ms Thompson hoped that Cosby will come clean about the mounting allegations against him. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, on Thursday. When Ms Thompson's story was originally revealed in November 2014, Singer called it 'absurd' to publish an 'unsubstantiated story from this anonymous person'. Scroll down for video . 'Jane Doe No.2' has revealed her identity and claimed that Bill Cosby (pictured in January) sexually assaulted her when she was a teenage model in New York . Thompson was one of the 13 Jane Does in a 2005 civil suit against Cosby from Andrea Constand. Miss Constand eventually settled out of court. Last Friday, Cosby's lawyers asked a federal judge to toss out a defamation lawsuit filed by three women - Tamara Green, Therese Serignese and Linda Traitz - accusing the beleaguered comedian of decades-old sexual offenses. The accusers, all of whom have stepped forward in recent years, said Cosby's representatives publicly branded them as liars while trying to defend his innocence. But Cosby's lawyers said the actor was merely acting in self-defense as his character was under attack. 'The law does not require that one stand idly by while he is publicly attacked,' the lawyers argued in their 38-page filing. 'Instead the law entitles an individual who is accused of serious wrongdoing to rebut the allegations without facing defamation claims.' Joseph Cammarata, a lawyer for the three accusers, said his clients disagree with that position. 'We believe that the law provides that when you make a public statement about an individual, it must be truthful,' he said. 'We look forward to an opportunity to have the truth tried by a jury who can ultimately determine which of the parties was being truthful.' Cosby's legal team has said their client denies all of the allegations of sexual misconduct. The former star of The Cosby Show hasn't been charged with any crime. More than a dozen women have stepped forward in recent years to level various assault accusations. Tamara Green, a 56-year-old California lawyer, says Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in her Los Angeles-area apartment in the early 1970s. Therese Serignese says Cosby drugged and raped her in a dressing room after a show in Las Vegas around 1976. And Linda Traitz alleges he tried to drug her and then groped her on a Southern California beach in about 1970. Tamara Green, a California lawyer, (left) filed a defamation lawsuit against Bill Cosby in December 2014 claiming that he and his attorneys said she had lied about a sexual assault from 40 years ago (she is pictured, right, at the time) Green was joined in the lawsuit by Linda Traitz (left), who alleged that Cosby tried to drug her and then sexually groped her in 1970, and nurse Therese Serignese (right), 57, who said the comic raped her in 1976 when she was 19 years old . Cosby's lawyers said his representatives were responding to the accusations in strongly-worded rebukes. One November 2014 statement references Traitz's 'extensive' criminal record, which includes larceny, fraud and drug possession charges. 'As the old saying goes, \"consider the source,\"' wrote Cosby attorney Martin Singer, who also attached copies of Traitz's Florida criminal and prison records with the statement. Another November 2014 statement cited by Cosby's accusers offers 'general comments' on the allegations and does not specifically name any of the accusers, his lawyers say. 'The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity,' Singer wrote at the time. 'It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop.' The three women seek an unspecified amount of money for compensatory and punitive damages. Many of the accusations against him exceed the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution. But the scandal has taken its toll on the 77-year-old actor and comedian as he has sought to revive his career with a national stand-up comedy tour. Cosby has canceled or postponed more than a dozen performances as more accusers have come forward, and women's groups have protested or threatened to rally at many of his public appearances. Lawyers for the three accusers have until March 20 to file a reply to Cosby's motion to dismiss the suit. Green originally filed the defamation lawsuit in December 2014 and Serignese and Traitz joined later. The suit is filed in US District Court in Springfield, in western Massachusetts.

{"raw_input": "Fears the notorious FLDS cult is planning to expand have been sparked after the brother of imprisoned leader Warren Jeffs applied to increase the water supply to the group's South Dakota compound. Seth Jeffs wants to double the amount of water it can draw from an aquifer in the 140-acre compound about 30 miles from Mount Rushmore. His request prompted concerns from neighbors and law enforcement about the possibility of members being displaced from their enclave on the Utah-Arizona border. He told state authorities that members of the United Order of South Dakota, a trust run by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) need more water for gardens, orchards and herds of animals. Seth Jeffs (pictured left), the brother of imprisoned cult leader Warren Jeffs (right) has applied to double the water available to the group's South Dakota compound, sparking fears of an influx of members there . Women and girls from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) can be seen wearing prairie dresses in Hildale, Utah . But with few details available and considering the group's troubled history, residents are worried members are planning a mass exodus from other areas to make Black Hills their new home. Warren Jeffs and other church leaders have been convicted of sexually assaulting underage girls . And while Seth Jeffs pleaded guilty in 2006 to harboring his then-fugitive brother, he did not face any sex abuse charges. South Dakota officials said that the local members of the FLDS, a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism, have never been in trouble with the law there. But Linda Van Dyke Kilcoin, one of several neighbors who filed petitions to intervene in the group's water request, said: 'As locals, we know what is going on in there and we don't want to see it expand. 'We value our 12-year-old girls in South Dakota.' An aerial shot shows buildings inside Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints compound near Pringle, South Dakota. The sect has applied to double the amount of water it can take from an aquifer . A log-cabin-style home is among the buildings on the FLDS compound that has nearly 50,000 square feet of residential space . Seth Jeffs declined to comment to The Associated Press, but told a local newspaper in January the compound is 'not growing right now' and members 'just need more water.' The request for more will likely be acted on in May. But Ms Kilcoin doubts it's for crop production. 'They're not going to irrigate. You ever been to Pringle? It's bedrock,' she said. 'You can't grow anything down there. They're bringing in a whole pile of people.' The group has said about 75 people live at the South Dakota ranch, according to a 2014 drinking water report filed with the state. The fenced-in compound, complete with a guard tower, sits on hilly, rugged land the group bought about 10 years ago - and was valued at $5.3 million for tax purposes. Inside the complex are seven large residences totaling nearly 50,000 square feet, a chapel and school, greenhouse, and several farm buildings. A sign warning against trespassing and dump trucks can be seen in operation on the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints compound about 30 miles from Mount Rushmore . Attorney General Marty Jackley, who said he's 'generally aware' of the activity at the compound, said the permit request and ongoing construction at the site 'are all indications that there is some level of expansion going on.' Mr Jackley said the group is on his radar because of what has gone on at FLDS sites in other states, and the additional law enforcement resources any expansion might require. Warren Jeffs is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2011 of abusing underage girls he considered his brides. Willie Jessop, who is Warren Jeffs' former bodyguard but left the cult in 2011, says he believes the group could be planning a move to South Dakota . For decades, members of his church have controlled the twin cities of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, but some are now being squeezed out by authorities ordering evictions because people haven't paid millions in overdue occupancy fees. Last year, the Texas government seized the group's Eldorado compound on the basis that the FLDS leaders financed a $1.1 million land purchase in 2003 through money laundering. Custer County Sheriff Rick Wheeler, whose jurisdiction includes the Black Hills compound, said when the group was evicted from its Texas property there was no indication they had moved to the compound near Pringle, citing a low level of traffic and activity. But now, he said that has changed and the group is hauling in more gravel and lumber. 'It's churning right now,' he said. Both Sam Brower, a private investigator who has spent years researching the FLDS, and Willie Jessop, Warren Jeffs' former bodyguard, agreed leaders could be preparing to move people to South Dakota from the shrinking Utah-Arizona enclave. Mr Brower said 'I think they are looking for places to move the elite,' adding that Seth Jeffs, like his brother, is considered royalty among devout members. Unlike most Mormons, members of FLDS believe polygamy will bring exaltation in heaven. Loyalists consider Jeffs a prophet who speaks for God and can do no wrong. Seth Jeffs, who originally sought to triple the amount of water the South Dakota ranch could draw, recently told the state he was scaling back his request to relieve the 'fears and concerns' of the U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service. William Hansen, chief of the Water Rights Branch of the NPS, said its main concern is the effect an additional well, without stricter limitations on usage, could have on Wind Cave National Park, since the FLDS draws from the same aquifer that has been forming the cave for millennia.

{"raw_input": "Being made redundant makes people less willing to trust others for up to a decade afterwards, according to a study. Losing a job in this way dents trust so badly that even finding new work fails to overcome the problem, the researchers found. It suggests that, even in later life, people can struggle to get over a firing in their life. The study was carried out by the University of Manchester. They found being made redundant made people less willing to trust others (stock image shown). People still showed the effect years after losing their job. 'Trauma like redundancy can shift people’s outlook of the world,' said Dr James Laurence of the university . Study author Dr James Laurence, from the University of Manchester, said: ‘People’s willingness to trust others tends to remain largely stable over their lifetime. ‘However, this work shows that trauma like redundancy can shift people’s outlook of the world and this change persists long after the experience occurred. ‘Society is still recovering from one of the longest recessions this century and much has been discussed in counting the economic costs of that. ‘Even a single experience of redundancy can lead to depressed trust and what is particularly concerning is that people reported less willingness to trust others even after they got another job. No matter how good your CV, it's your voice that may actually help you land the job. Researchers found recruiters rated candidates as more competent, thoughtful and intelligent when they heard the pitch than when they read it - even when the words used were exactly the same. They also discovered evaluators who listened to trained actors reading job candidates' written pitches out loud believed those candidates were more intelligent and wanted to hire them more than the evaluators who read candidates' own written pitches. The new study by University of Chicago Booth School of Business Professor Nicholas Epley and PhD candidate Juliana Schroeder also found the addition of video did not influence evaluations beyond hearing the candidate's voice. ‘This has important implications not just for the person involved but for society as a whole as trust can have significant benefits, from health and happiness, to social cohesion, efficient democratic governance and economic development.’ The study, which was published in the journal Social Science Research, involved data from almost 7,000 British adults followed as part of the National Child Development Study of adults born in March 1958. Responses from 1991, when the individuals were 33, were compared with responses from 2008, when they were 50, noting whether they had experienced involuntary job loss from redundancy, downsizing or restructuring in the period in between. Their responses showed that at age 50, those who had been made redundant were 4.5 per cent less likely to express trust in others than those who had not been laid off. Among those who said at the age of 33 that it was very important to be in work, the figure rose to seven per cent. To find out how long the effect of redundancy continues, the data was split into groups according to the age they were laid off: ages 33-41 (but not 41-50); 41-50 (but not 33-41) and both 33-41 and 41-50. Their responses showed that at age 50, those who had been made redundant were 4.5 per cent less likely to express trust in others than those who had not been laid off (stock image shown). Among those who said at the age of 33 that it was very important to be in work, the figure rose to seven per cent . ‘We observe that experiencing displacement within any age group has a significant negative effect on trust,’ said Dr Laurence. ‘Importantly, individuals who experienced displacement between the ages of 33-41 but not 41-50 are therefore also likely to report lower trust at age 50. ‘This is suggestive that the effect of displacement can persist at least nine years after the event occurred.’ He added: ‘The greater the attachment to employment, the stronger the negative effect of displacement. ‘A range of mediators, such as physical health, mental well-being, and personal efficacy, do not appear to account for the effect. ‘That the effect remains present at least nine years after the even occurred demonstrates the severity of displacement experiences.’", "raw_output": "The study was carried out by the University of Manchester .\nThey found being made redundant made people less willing to trust others .\nPeople still showed the effect years after losing their job .\n'Trauma like redundancy can shift people’s outlook of the world,' said Dr James Laurence of the university .", "trunc_input": "Being made redundant makes people less willing to trust others for up to a decade afterwards, according to a study.

The 22-year-old woman, identified only by her first name Laura, was held down in a church in Buenos Aires, Argentina as Bishop Manuel Acuna, 52, ordered a demon to leave her body. As she screamed 'no, no' and shouted abuse at one of the women holding her down, Bishop Acuna was heard muttering: 'Leave, leave her now.' Pictures have emerged of a woman being pinned to the ground while writhing in pain as priests performed an exorcism . The 22-year-old woman (pictured), identified only by her first name Laura, was held down in a church in Buenos Aires, Argentina . Bishop Manuel Acuna (pictured), 52, stood over Laura and ordered a demon to leave her body . Before the exorcism, locals gathered at the Lutheran Charismatic Church praying for her soul and redemption. Bishop Acuna told them: 'The demon exists. He's not an idea, he's not a theory, he's not something abstract. 'The devil is a personality and therefore has a strategy. We are talking about something terrifying, a fallen angel. The devil is not a metaphor. 'The devil is something real that Jesus Christ faced. The devil looks for the perdition of the human being and for this he will use any possible evil instrument.' Laura (pictured) screamed 'No, No' and shouted 'Whore' at one of the women holding her down . Intervention: Bishop Acuna was heard muttering 'leave, leave her now' as the woman was being pinned down . Locals said they could hear Laura 'screaming and crying' from inside a chamber at the church in Buenos Aires . Laura was then led into a chamber where church helpers held her to the ground. Local man Augustus Amador Arevalo, 32, who had gone to pray for her said: 'We could hear her screaming and crying and we prayed for her deliverance. 'She was a good girl but turned bad when the devil possessed her. She had to be exorcised, she had to be free.' The exorcism came to an end when she suddenly gave a strangled cry and closed her eyes, falling backwards exhausted. The exorcism reportedly took place at the Lutheran Charismatic Church in Buenos Aires, Argentina . Bishop Manuel Acuna (pictured) said Laura had encountered 'a group of demons similar to the ones that Jesus faced' The exorcism came to an end when she suddenly gave a strangled cry and closed her eyes, falling backwards exhausted . She could be seen wiping away tears as the priest once again made the sign of the cross over her body. Bishop Acuna said: 'Thank God, we've recovered a daughter of God. You haven't seen a major exorcism. 'This was a group of demons similar to the ones that Jesus faced.

The 23-year-old copped a backlash after she said: 'Indonesia has these rules and if you break them these are the consequences'.

On Thursday's The Grill segment, the model and TV presenter said the laws in Indonesia regarding drugs are widely known. 'It's so sad. I mean, watching all the footage play out on the news... it breaks your heart because you can't help but feel for their families and they are two humans at the end of the day,' she said. 'But, like a lot of Australians believe, at the end of the day unfortunately, Indonesia has these rules and if you break them these are the consequences. 'It's so sad, I do not agree with the death penalty, but that's their law.' Some viewers criticised her stance and accused her of supporting more extreme execution methods. 'So I guess you agree with all other atrocities committed by authority figures because \"It's the law\"? Stoning ok too?' Chandy Shah asked Campbell on Twitter. Jestina hit back by saying: 'I was asked to share my opinion on this 1 particular case. I wasn't asked about stoning don't try to parcel it all together.'

'They are now reformed men who are making a positive difference to the lives of their fellow prisoners. 'For this reason, I would ask that you stop the execution of Andrew and Myuran. 'Please allow them to serve out life sentences where they contribute to the well-being of Indonesia and make good for the error of their previous ways.'

Making the journey: The likely area on Death Island where Chan and Sukumaran will take their final breaths is called, Nirbaya . This comes as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop used parliament to directly plead with the Indonesian president. Ms Bishop told parliament on Wednesday that Indonesian authorities were preparing for the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. 'On behalf of the parliament, I respectfully ask of the Indonesian president that he spare the lives of these two Australian citizens,' Ms Bishop said. She said she had spoken with the two families on Wednesday morning. 'As you can imagine they are devastated but they are just living day by day,' she said. A plea for clemency was rejected in January but since then the government has been seeking a permanent stay of execution. Ms Bishop said there were grounds for clemency and the government believed there were still legal avenues open to the pair.

Mr Kesoema said both cases had been granted due process of law and all legal avenues had been pursued. He defended the court's decision to impose the death penalty and said separation of powers meant the government could not meddle in judicial processes.

Nic Taylor, 32, a photographer from St Helens, Merseyside, filmed Lucas's reaction as Gemma rips off strips of sellotape while wrapping Mother's Day gifts. Five-month-old Lucas is relaxed until he hears the loud noise of his mother unwrapping a roll of sellotape . The footage shows the five-month-old boy perched in an interactive baby walker wearing in a onesie with the television on in the background. Although the child is surrounded by an array of toys, he remains uninterested and motionless, until his mother begins noisily unwrapping the tape. At the first loud rip, Lucas jumps and his face is a picture of shock as he stares at his mother, mouth wide open, with a horrified expression on his face. He looks alarmed for a while and then relaxes momentarily, gazing back at the television. Upon hearing the loud rip, he looks visibly panicked and looks at his mother with a worried expression . What on earth is that? Catching Lucas' hilariously panicked reactions, his mother laughs and apologies to him . As his mother loudly pulls off another strip of sellotape, the baby boy jolts again, rattling his toys from his shock, with a look of sheer panic on his face.

Owner Dave Whelan, 78, stepped down from his day-to-day duties at the DW Stadium after 20 years this week and entrusted those responsibilities to his young grandson. Although that succession plan had long been in the pipeline for the Whelan family, the fact Sharpe is coming into a position of power at such a tender age still raised eyebrows. David Sharpe is the new chairman of Wigan Athletic after taking over from his grandfather Dave Whelan . Whelan stepped down from his day-to-day duties at the club and handed over the role to his grandson . However, Mackay is familiar with Sharpe having worked closely alongside him since his appointment in November and the 23-year-old, who was only officially appointed on to the board on Christmas Eve, took on a more central role with chief executive Jonathan Jackson during the recent six-week ban imposed on Whelan by the Football Association. And Mackay has seen enough of Sharpe to be convinced the Sky Bet Championship outfit are in excellent hands. 'It's easy to have a throwaway line about a 23-year-old taking over a football club but he's been round about the football club since he was a young man,' said Mackay. 'He's here every day, is at every game and knows the inside of the football club. I look at the experience and the amount of time somebody has been at a football club. Malky Mackay is familiar with Sharpe and believes the 23-year-old will be a good chairman at the club . 'He's got good people round about him and I know the things that drive him, the things he's passionate about and they are good values for wanting a football club to go forward in terms of academy and recruitment.' Whelan had cited his age as the motivating factor behind his decision to step back and he will address Wigan supporters to say farewell before Saturday's home clash with Leeds. Mackay has only been at the club for a few months but paid tribute to the impact Whelan had made on the 2013 FA Cup winners, who he took from the fourth tier into the top flight, where they spent eight seasons prior to relegation two seasons ago. Mackay also paid tribute to Whelan for the work he did as Wigan chairman over the last 20 years . Whelan kisses the FA Cup after Wigan beat Manchester City at Wembley before being relegated in 2013 . 'He's put his heart, soul and life into this football club over the last 20 years,' added the Scot. 'I played at Springfield Park a long time ago and to then 20 years later have a team that have a beautiful stadium, a lovely training ground and have won the FA Cup and played in the Premier League is quite a story in anybody's book.

Showing the monks with painted faces and beads strung around their necks, these incredible images were taken by  Italian photographer Cristiano Ostinelli, who spent time with the tribe to discover more about their way of life. The mysterious tribe members live in cemeteries and feast on human flesh as part of their rituals, as well as drinking from human skulls, chewing the heads off live animals and meditating on top of cadavers in search of spiritual enlightenment. The Aghori monks of Varanasi are feared throughout India and are believed to be able to see the future . Italian photographer Cristiano Ostinelli spent time with the mysterious tribe to capture their mysterious way of life . The monks feast on human flesh, drink from human skulls and are even said to bite the heads off life animals for their rituals . Mr Ostinelli explained: 'There is a great mystery around them and the Indians fear them, they say they can predict the future, walk on water and do evil prophecies.' The monks use a combination of marijuana, alcohol and meditation to help them reach a disconnected state of heightened awareness and bring themselves closer to revered Hindu god Lord Shiva. The Aghori also believe that by immersing themselves without prejudice in what others deem taboo or disturbing, they're on course to achieving enlightenment. The Varanasi tribe live near cremation sites and use a combination of alcohol and marijuana with meditation to reach enlightenment . The monks trace their roots to the 17th-century puritan Baba Kinaram, who is said to have lived to the age of 170 . With painted faces and often seen wearing little or no clothing, their way of life is said to discourage an attachment to earthly delusions . The monks believe that the body is inconsequential and flesh and blood are simply transitory, which is why they surround themselves with death and decay . They live among India's cremation sites - where Lord Shiva and goddess Kali Ma are said to dwell - and feed on what others throw away.

{"raw_input": "In the dream scenario Steven Gerrard's final action in a Liverpool shirt will be the lifting of the FA Cup at Wembley Stadium on May 30, his 35th birthday. It will be emotional. For more than 16 years Gerrard was Anfield's beating heart. The good times were great. He gave them Istanbul, a crazy, glorious night forever etched into the club's history. A year later, in 2006, it was his last-minute long-range strike that gave them life against West Ham in Cardiff. Steven Gerrard returned to Liverpool training earlier this week after almost a month out with injury . The club captain led Liverpool to Champions League glory against AC Milan in 2005 . In total there was a Champions League, a Uefa Cup, two FA Cups and three League Cups. Even in the bad times (and there were plenty as a Premier League title remained elusive) the local boy was a source of Scouse inspiration. When Roy Hodgson wobbled and King Kenny came back but could only lead them to eighth, punters in pubs from Formby to Fazakerley could take solace. 'At least we've got Stevie G'. From next season, however, they will not. They appear to be giant boots to fill. Imagining a Liverpool without Gerrard is like imagining The Beatles without Paul McCartney. But the show must go on and, in Jordan Henderson, Brendan Rodgers might just have the ideal replacement. A year later Gerrard inspired the Reds to an FA Cup win against West Ham . A Liverpool team without Steven Gerrard will be like The Beatles without Paul McCartney (front left) His goalkeeper certainly thinks so. After Wednesday's 2-0 win over Burnley Simon Mignolet cast an early vote for May's Anfield election. 'Jordan is a massive player for us,' he said. 'He is a very positive character who always works hard and leads by example. 'He's vocal both on the pitch and in the dressing room. He goes in front of us and everyone follows behind.' Can Henderson lead from the front like Gerrard? Can he carry the team on his back? Some would point to the penalty spat with Mario Balotelli as evidence that the 24-year-old is not cut out for the job. Jordan Henderson has led the team in Gerrard's absence as Liverpool have made a charge for the top four . Henderson has been in inspired form for Liverpool and struck sensational goals in his last two games . Gerrard, they say, would never have let the Italian take the ball. He would have shown him who was boss. The man himself said as much. But they would be wrong to criticise. Balotelli, being Balotelli, was always going to try and take the penalty. And why not? Have you seen his record? Out of 29 penalties he has scored 27. Aside from his unpredictability, scoring from the spot is one of few things consistent about madcap Mario and Henderson, who has never taken a penalty in such a high-stakes environment, will have known that. For the good of the team he made the right call not to make a fuss. Surely that is the mark of a good captain? Gerrard, a fine skipper, was the master of responding to adversity and Henderson is no stranger to ramming critics' barbs back from whence they came. Since Sir Alex Ferguson's trial by autobiography he has written promising new chapters in his Liverpool career. Against Burnley he hit a netbuster from distance and then slid to his knees in front of the Kop. Sound familiar? Henderson celebrates after finding the top corner against Manchester City last weekend . In the five games Hemderson has played since Gerrard's absence Liverpool have won all five matches . His accent may be more Wearside than Whiston but Henderson is now being talked up as a successor and for good reason. He is not alone. There is a growing clamour to hand the armband to the Emre Can. The midfielder-turned-defender has been impressive since his backwards switch and was first to pick up Dejan Lovren following his penalty miss at Besiktas. The '#beast' is only 21, however, and his time will come. Time will be up for US-bound Gerrard at Stoke or at Wembley. Whether it's in Brent or at the Britannia, Liverpool will bid a painful farewell to their talisman and he will be missed. But if Gerrard remained the player that so often dragged his side from the turf Rodgers would not have allowed him to leave and that is worth noting when the inevitable tears are shed at his watershed. In the six Premier League games that Gerrard has missed this season Liverpool have won them all . It is easy to get sentimental when it comes to such a figure. Gerrard deserves to be remembered as a legend because, in this world where the word is bandied about at the drop of the hat, he is one. The fact of the matter, however, is that his impact has lessened considerably in recent times. In the Premier League this season Liverpool have played 22 games with Gerrard in the side. They have won nine of those, drawn six and lost seven at an average of 1.3 goals for, 1.3 against and 1.5 points per game. Without Gerrard they have played six games and won them all with an average of 2.3 goals for to 0.3 goals against.

His accent may be more Wearside than Whiston but Henderson is now being talked up as a successor and for good reason. He is not alone. There is a growing clamour to hand the armband to the Emre Can. The midfielder-turned-defender has been impressive since his backwards switch and was first to pick up Dejan Lovren following his penalty miss at Besiktas. The '#beast' is only 21, however, and his time will come. Time will be up for US-bound Gerrard at Stoke or at Wembley. Whether it's in Brent or at the Britannia, Liverpool will bid a painful farewell to their talisman and he will be missed. But if Gerrard remained the player that so often dragged his side from the turf Rodgers would not have allowed him to leave and that is worth noting when the inevitable tears are shed at his watershed. In the six Premier League games that Gerrard has missed this season Liverpool have won them all . It is easy to get sentimental when it comes to such a figure. Gerrard deserves to be remembered as a legend because, in this world where the word is bandied about at the drop of the hat, he is one. The fact of the matter, however, is that his impact has lessened considerably in recent times. In the Premier League this season Liverpool have played 22 games with Gerrard in the side. They have won nine of those, drawn six and lost seven at an average of 1.3 goals for, 1.3 against and 1.5 points per game. Without Gerrard they have played six games and won them all with an average of 2.3 goals for to 0.3 goals against. Maybe those boots are not as big as they used to be.", "trunc_output": "Steven Gerrard is leaving Liverpool in the summer to join LA Galaxy .\nLiverpool's vice-captain Jordan Henderson has impressed

Photographs of the barbaric murders show the blindfolded men kneeling in the centre of what appears to be a traffic roundabout with a crowd of people looking on as a masked executioner stands by with a long, rusty blade. After an elderly man uses a microphone to read to the crowd from his notes, the executioner then steps forward with the blade poised above the men's heads in the unnamed city in northern Iraq. The executioner stands with the sword poised above the man's head as a large crowd gathers to watch . The beheading appears to take place at a traffic roundabout in northern Iraq's Nineveh province . One of the blindfolded victims kneels with his head forward immediately prior to the beheading. Messages accompanying the images claimed two men were accused of homosexuality and a third of blasphemy . An elderly man reads to the crowd from his notes in the moments leading up to the three men's deaths . Accompanying captions said the trio were then beheaded - two for engaging in homosexual acts and the third for alleged blasphemy - but there were no images released of the actual beheading. The jihadist group, which controls swathes of Iraq and neighbouring Syria, has carried out hundreds of barbaric executions as it has imposed its brutal version of Islamic law, many of which are photographed or videotaped. The photos were said to have been taken in Nineveh province - the first to fall to a sweeping IS-led offensive last June - but the exact location was not specified. Many young men have also been thrown from the roofs of buildings throughout ISIS-controlled areas after being accused of engaging in homosexual acts. The stomach-churning photographs usually show a blindfolded victim being dragged to the top of a building by black-masked militants.

{"raw_input": "An ex-CFO and Chick-fil-A protestor who lost his job after posting a video rant against one of the chain's employees  has since lost his home and lives on food stamps. Adam Mark Smith, 37, who worked for an Arizona-based medical device manufacturer, was shamed after the 2012 YouTube video was posted showing him berating employee Rachel Elizabeth. The video which expressed his disdain over the firm's anti-gay marriage stance went viral, and left him unemployed and forced to lose his home. Nearly three years later, the married father of four is still searching for a job and his family previously had to give away possessions before he was hired and fired again, according to ABC. Scroll down for video . Adam Smith was the former CFO of an Arizona-based medical device manufacturer, before he was fired after posting a video of himself berating a Chick-fil-A employee for the fast-food chain's anti-gay marriage stance . Three years later from the viral video that shook his life from riches to rags, the married father of four is still searching for a job (Smith above with his family) At the time he was working as CFO for Vante, Smith was earning $200,000 annually and had more than $1million in stock options, but he said it was all taken from him when he was fired. His 2012 firing was reported on the same day as the counter-protest against Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day as thousands of gay couples flocked to restaurants to kiss during the summer of 2012. Things were looking rough for Smith and his wife, Amy, along with their four sons after they lost their home and moved into an RV. But there was silver lining for him and the chance for a new start when he was offered a new job as a CFO in Portland a few months later. 'I felt like, \"yeah, I got it. I am back'',' he said. However, nearly two weeks later, he was fired once again after his boss realized he was the man from the video. In the 2012 video that went viral, he told Chick-fil-A employee Rachel Elizabeth while at the drive-thru window that he did not know how she lived with herself and worked there . Smith posted a follow-up video apologizing to Elizabeth (above) which she accepted . As the incident continues to haunt him, he said he does not regret the stand he took but he regrets the way he spoke to Elizabeth. While Smith is unsure if the incident will ever go away, he has turned to meditation, and has written a memoir, A Million Dollar Cup of Water: Discovering the Wealth in Authenticity. The controversy surrounding one of America's biggest fast-food chains began in 2012 after a series of anti-same sex marriage statements from Chick-fil-A's COO Dan T. Cathy. Local media had previously reported that the company, founded in 1946 by Cathy’s father, S. Truett Cathy, sponsored several organisations and group which actively oppose LGBT rights and same-sex marriage. Chick-fil-A donated more than $3million between 2003 and 2009 to Christian organizations with a well-known anti-gay agenda, and in 2010 alone Chick-fil-A gave nearly $2million to such causes, according to reports. In June and July 2012, Dan Cathy made several statements against gay marriage. When asked about Chick-fil-A’s backing of ‘traditional’ families with a husband and wife, Cathy responded 'Well, guilty as charged’. He also stated that Chick-fil-A is runs on 'traditional Christian values' and is 'very much supportive of the family — the biblical definition of the family unit'. In response, gay rights protesters launched nationwide boycotts and staged same-sex 'kiss-ins' at Chick-fil-A stores across the country. The book tells of how his backlash from the public took him from riches to rags, to 'true wealth'. In job interviews Smith is honest about the video, he said, but he thinks employers are scared to hire him because they think it could possibly reoccur again. In the original video posted three years ago, Smith waits in line for a free promotional water at a Chick-fil-A before expressing his disdain for the firm's support for traditional Christian marriage. Filmed by Smith on his own phone, the former CFO gets to the window of the drive-thru and starts to all-out bully the young female employee behind the counter, who remains calm and polite throughout the whole exchange. He said: 'I don't know how you live with yourself and work here. I don't understand it. This is a horrible corporation with horrible values.' Elizabeth tells him repeatedly to have a nice day and that it is a pleasure to serve him as well as saying: 'I'm staying neutral on this subject. My personal beliefs don't belong in the workplace.' As he drives off he tells the worker: 'I'm a nice guy by the way, and I'm totally heterosexual. Just can't stand the hate. It's gotta stop guys, stand up.' Once he posted the video and went back to work, he said his employees were shocked. Smith told 20/20: 'I got into work and the receptionist, the first thing, big eyes, 'Adam, what did you do?', she said. 'The voicemail is completely full, and it's full of bomb threats.'' After the video went viral, according to a MarketWire statement, Smith was fired from his job at Vante, Inc. They released a statement saying: 'The actions of Mr Smith do not reflect our corporate values in any manner. Vante is an equal opportunity company with a diverse workforce, which holds diverse opinions. In his apology video, Smith told Elizabeth he was sorry for the way he spoke to her and that she handled the situation with dignity and grace . Wanda Flory, of Swanton, Ohio, center, watches with Terry, (left), and her husband Richard, (center right), as Thea Grabiec, (right), kisses Sarah Shovan during the counter-protest against Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day . Smith also told Elizabeth in his apology video that he was angry by the number of people who were supporting Chick-fil-A during the Appreciation Day and became unraveled . 'We respect the right of our employees and all Americans to hold and express their personal opinions, however, we also expect our company officers to behave in a manner commensurate with their position and in a respectful fashion that conveys these values of civility with others.' After losing his job at Vante, Smith removed his original video from YouTube and posted an eight-minute video apology to Elizabeth. 'I am so very sorry for the way I spoke to you,' said Smith in the video. 'You handled my frustrating rant with such dignity and composure. 'Every time I watch the video I am blown away by really the beauty in what you did, and your kindness, and your patience with me.' Smith explained that he was enraged by the number of people that had come out to support the chicken fast-food firm during last weeks 'Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day' and lost his cool. Shown Smith's apology by an anchor on Fox News at the time, Elizabeth accepted it. She said: 'I do forgive him. I think he realizes how bad it was to make that tape.

{"raw_input": "They might have thousands of pounds to spend on the best products and make-up artists at their beck and call but sometimes celebrities still slip up when it comes to their slap. This week Kylie Jenner showed up to a Nip and Fab event sporting a two-toned chest, which appeared to be the result of badly applied contouring bronzer, leaving her with an unfortunate tide mark around her breasts. But the 17-year-old is not alone as stars like Angelina Jolie, Drew Barrymore and Kim Kardashian have all had very public make-up mishaps. Scroll down for video . When Kylie Jenner attended an event for Nip and Fab recently it was clear to see that she had tried to contour her chest but the powder had not been blended in properly . Kylie posed happily on the red carpet in a see through top, unfortunately it seemed she hadn't noticed her make-up mishap . But it seems Kylie - who has recently been announced as an ambassador for the beauty brand - didn't even notice her two-tone cleavage. She happily posed away while photographers snapped the bronzing boo-boo, yet the youngest of the Kardashian clan is not the first celeb to fail prey to a make-up malfunction. In fact her sister Kim, the ultimate queen of contouring, recently had a bit of a fail herself. While Kim showcased her dramatic new platinum 'do in Paris during Fashion Week, she had paid less attention to her make-up and stepped out with a  brown line running down her nose which hadn't been blended properly. Darkening the centre of the nose and highlighting the sides is a make-up artist's trick for making the feature look thin and straight. The 34-year-old is well known for her love of highlighter and deep contouring which excentuates her cheekbones. Whilst out and about for Paris Fashion Week Kim, who usually has perfect make-up, was spotted with a dodgy looking brown stripe going down her nose . Other stars such as Angelina Jolie have also previously had maquillage 'mares. The actress was photographed at the premiere of The Normal Heart, to support husband Brad Pitt who produced the flick, with pale white powder in patches on her face. Experts guessed that her make-up artist had been liberal with the translucent powder which mattifies skin without adding colour to it. However the product - which works well in photoshoots when the light can be controlled - is less forgiving on the red carpet. With so many flashbulbs going off, the light reflects off one of main ingredients in the powder, silica. Angelina Jolie is one of the most famous stars to have suffered for a make up malfunction, she was once seen covered in white powder that hadn't been rubbed in properly . Clearly Angelina's husband Brad did not see fit to tell Angelina that she was suffering from a make up malfunction as the pair attended a screening of The Normal Heart . But Angelina is far from the only celebrity to be coated in the face powder only to find it looks like she's been flour-bombed in photos. At the 2003 premiere of Charlie's Angels, Drew Barrymore looked as though she was trying a geisha-inspired avant garde  look. The former child star had so much white powder around her eyes she seemed to be wearing a white mask. Drew Barrymore looked a fright at the 2003 London premiere of Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle . Nicole Kidman sported white powder on her nose and under her eyes, possibly a result of using powder intended for HD film, not a camera flash at the Nine film premiere in NYC in 2009 . And the usually pristine-looking Nicole Kidman experienced a similar problem at the 2009 premiere of Nine in New York. The Australian star had white patches beneath her eyes and a smear on the end of her nose that looked as though she'd just done some rather messy baking. Eva Longoria revealed her own penchant for translucent powder on a night out with Entourage actor Kevin Connolly in 2011. While her bronzed cheeks glowed, beneath her perfectly applied smoky eyes, the Desperate Housewives star sported a thick line of white powder, making her look like Adam Ant. Eva Longoria displayed white powder under her eyes as she left a sushi restaurant in Hollywood with Kevin Connolly in 2011 . Jessica Biel sported a touch of white powder on her nose at a film premiere in New York in 2010 . Melissa Joan Hart sported a huge white smear across her forehead and chalky remnants around her eyes and nostrils at a film premiere in LA in November 2013 . Actress Ashley Judd isn't immune from a bad make-up job, pictured in NYC in 2011 . Meanwhile, it's not just US celebs who seem to put their make-up on in the dark. TV presenter Claudia Winkleman fell prey to an attack of the eyeliner at the GQ awards in 2013 when her smudged look went really wrong. The Strictly star is known for her distinctive Sixties-inspired style with a heavy blunt fringe, strong eyeliner, bronzed skin and pale lips. However, at the event it looked as though she'd applied her eye make-up in the car on the way to the show with liner so smeared it was streaked well below her lash line. Jennifer Aniston wisely sticks to natural make-up to enhance her year-round tan, piercing blue eyes and tawny long, layered hair. But at a screening of Call Me Crazy in Los Angeles in 2013, she was left with marks from a cupping treatment, which she attempted to disguise with liberal applications of powder. The result was that rather than a series of marks from the treatment that uses suction cups on the skin, there were discs of bronzer all over her back instead. At the GQ Awards in 2013 Claudia Winkleman turned heads for all the wrong reasons with her bizarre smokey eyed make up . Jennifer Aniston tried to use make-up to cover-up the remnants of a cupping treatment, but the foundation only made the circles look worse at the Los Angeles screening of Call Me Crazy in 2013 . But for every unintentional make-up mishap celebrities have worn perfectly-applied - but badly judged -  lipstick, powder and paint. Gossip Girl Leighton Meester stepped out looking vampish in purple eyeshadow that had been painted around her eye sockets, and almost into her hairline. While America's Next Top Model judge Tyra Banks is famous for inventing the 'smize' (smiling with your eyes)  at a New York City party in 2012 she took it too far - liberally painting black shadow across both lids. Her garish pink lips did nothing to improve the look either. While many everyday women admit to applying their make-up on the move, it seems celebrities are guilty of the same grooming crime. Leighton Meester wore garish purple eyeshadow made worse with red lips at a NYC event in 2009 . Tyra Banks looked like she had done her make-up in the dark with her thick black eyeshadow and neon pink lips at a ball in New York City in 2012 .", "raw_output": "Kylie Jenner was recently spotted with a bronzer tide-line on her breasts .\nThe young TV stars' contouring make-up hadn't been blended  properly .\nAngelina Jolie, Drew Barrymore and Nicole Kidman had powder fails too .", "trunc_input": "They might have thousands of pounds to spend on the best products and make-up artists at their beck and call but sometimes celebrities still slip up when it comes to their slap. This week Kylie Jenner showed up to a Nip and Fab event sporting a two-toned chest, which appeared to be the result of badly applied contouring bronzer, leaving her with an unfortunate tide mark around her breasts. But the 17-year-old is not alone as stars like Angelina Jolie, Drew Barrymore and Kim Kardashian have all had very public make-up mishaps. Scroll down for video . When Kylie Jenner attended an event for Nip and Fab recently it was clear to see that she had tried to contour her chest but the powder had not been blended in properly . Kylie posed happily on the red carpet in a see through top, unfortunately it seemed she hadn't noticed her make-up mishap . But it seems Kylie - who has recently been announced as an ambassador for the beauty brand - didn't even notice her two-tone cleavage. She happily posed away while photographers snapped the bronzing boo-boo, yet the youngest of the Kardashian clan is not the first celeb to fail prey to a make-up malfunction. In fact her sister Kim, the ultimate queen of contouring, recently had a bit of a fail herself. While Kim showcased her dramatic new platinum 'do in Paris during Fashion Week, she had paid less attention to her make-up and stepped out with a  brown line running down her nose which hadn't been blended properly. Darkening the centre of the nose and highlighting the sides is a make-up artist's trick for making the feature look thin and straight. The 34-year-old is well known for her love of highlighter and deep contouring which excentuates her cheekbones. Whilst out and about for Paris Fashion Week Kim, who usually has perfect make-up, was spotted with a dodgy looking brown stripe going down her nose . Other stars such as Angelina Jolie have also previously had maquillage 'mares. The actress was photographed at the premiere of The Normal Heart, to support husband Brad Pitt who produced the flick, with pale white powder in patches on her face. Experts guessed that her make-up artist had been liberal with the translucent powder which mattifies skin without adding colour to it. However the product - which works well in photoshoots when the light can be controlled - is less forgiving on the red carpet. With so many flashbulbs going off, the light reflects off one of main ingredients in the powder, silica. Angelina Jolie is one of the most famous stars to have suffered for a make up malfunction, she was once seen covered in white powder that hadn't been rubbed in properly . Clearly Angelina's husband Brad did not see fit to tell Angelina that she was suffering from a make up malfunction as the pair attended a screening of The Normal Heart . But Angelina is far from the only celebrity to be coated in the face powder only to find it looks like she's been flour-bombed in photos. At the 2003 premiere of Charlie's Angels, Drew Barrymore looked as though she was trying a geisha-inspired avant garde  look. The former child star had so much white powder around her eyes she seemed to be wearing a white mask. Drew Barrymore looked a fright at the 2003 London premiere of Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle . Nicole Kidman sported white powder on her nose and under her eyes, possibly a result of using powder intended for HD film, not a camera flash at the Nine film premiere in NYC in 2009 . And the usually pristine-looking Nicole Kidman experienced a similar problem at the 2009 premiere of Nine in New York. The Australian star had white patches beneath her eyes and a smear on the end of her nose that looked as though she'd just done some rather messy baking. Eva Longoria revealed her own penchant for translucent powder on a night out with Entourage actor Kevin Connolly in 2011. While her bronzed cheeks glowed, beneath her perfectly applied smoky eyes, the Desperate Housewives star sported a thick line of white powder, making her look like Adam Ant. Eva Longoria displayed white powder under her eyes as she left a sushi restaurant in Hollywood with Kevin Connolly in 2011 . Jessica Biel sported a touch of white powder on her nose at a film premiere in New York in 2010 . Melissa Joan Hart sported a huge white smear across her forehead and chalky remnants around her eyes and nostrils at a film premiere in LA in November 2013 . Actress Ashley Judd isn't immune from a bad make-up job, pictured in NYC in 2011 . Meanwhile, it's not just US celebs who seem to put their make-up on in the dark. TV presenter Claudia Winkleman fell prey to an attack of the eyeliner at the GQ awards in 2013 when her smudged look went really wrong. The Strictly star is known for her distinctive Sixties-inspired style with a heavy blunt fringe, strong eyeliner, bronzed skin and pale lips. However, at the event it looked as though she'd applied her eye make-up in the car on the way to the show with liner so smeared it was streaked well below her lash line. Jennifer Aniston wisely sticks to natural make-up to enhance her year-round tan, piercing blue eyes and tawny long, layered hair. But at a screening of Call Me Crazy in Los Angeles in 2013, she was left with marks from a cupping treatment, which she attempted to disguise with liberal applications of powder. The result was that rather than a series of marks from the treatment that uses suction cups on the skin, there were discs of bronzer all over her back instead.

{"raw_input": "An executive with the supermarket giant Morrisons has been jailed for 12 months for a £203,000 insider trading crime. Paul Coyle, 50, profited from dealing in his company’s shares around the time of a £216m deal with the online retailer Ocado which sent share values soaring. Using the name of his partner he bought Morrisons shares before the lucrative tie-up was made public and sold them for a profit the day after it was announced. Paul Coyle, 50, has been jailed for a year after he used his inside knowledge at Morrisons to personally profit in shares . Coyle was the supermarket’s group treasurer and head of tax and was ‘at the heart’ of talks with Ocado over the development of their online business. He illegally used his inside knowledge for personal profit. The series of deals – in the name of 28-year-old Emma Baker – made a profit of £79,431. However, the total ‘benefit’ from his crime which he must repay was put at £203,234. This was comprised of the value of shares bought and profits from the deals. He faces a further two-and-a-half years behind bars if the money is not repaid within two months, Leeds Crown Court was told. Coyle, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, admitted two charges of insider dealing and was also ordered to pay £15,000 costs. Mr Justice Globe said while he accepted his remorse was genuine, his offending was so serious there had to be an immediate jail term. ‘You came into possession of that information by your senior position within the organisation. Your breach of trust was significant,’ he said. ‘Whatever your real motivation was, your actions were deliberate and in my judgment dishonest. You knew at the time what you were doing was illegal. Your actions continued over a three month period and involved a number of individual trades.’ The judge told him: ‘insider dealing is not a victimless crime, harm has been caused by your actions, it has an impact on the overall public confidence in the integrity of the market.’ Coyle, a former Inland Revenue inspector, was a senior and trusted member of the Morrisons executive team. Laura Mackinnon, prosecuting, said he signed documents indicating he was aware of the restrictions imposed by his ‘insider’ status. He initially made a £8,000 profit by buying company shares before the March 2013 announcement that discussions were being held with Ocado and selling them the day after. He bought around the time of a £216m deal between Morrisons and the online retailer Ocado which sent share values soaring and sold the day after it was announced . The father-of-four continued to abuse his position by buying and selling a further 100,000 shares as the company share price fluctuated amid market speculation. During that period he banked a further £11,000. Then in May, after an official announcement was made that the two firms had reached a formal agreement, he sold the rest of his shares making £60,000. Neil Hawes, QC, defending, said Coyle had not touched the money he had made. He said his client had been under stress in his job as senior staff were ‘fire- fighting’ issues in the company. ‘He accepts he had a senior and important role at Morrison, he was in the confidence of senior management, privy to confidential material and trusted.’ Coyle lost his job and has not worked since.

Paul Coyle, 50, profited from dealing in his company’s shares around the time of a £216m deal with the online retailer Ocado which sent share values soaring. Using the name of his partner he bought Morrisons shares before the lucrative tie-up was made public and sold them for a profit the day after it was announced. Paul Coyle, 50, has been jailed for a year after he used his inside knowledge at Morrisons to personally profit in shares . Coyle was the supermarket’s group treasurer and head of tax and was ‘at the heart’ of talks with Ocado over the development of their online business. He illegally used his inside knowledge for personal profit. The series of deals – in the name of 28-year-old Emma Baker – made a profit of £79,431. However, the total ‘benefit’ from his crime which he must repay was put at £203,234. This was comprised of the value of shares bought and profits from the deals. He faces a further two-and-a-half years behind bars if the money is not repaid within two months, Leeds Crown Court was told. Coyle, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, admitted two charges of insider dealing and was also ordered to pay £15,000 costs. Mr Justice Globe said while he accepted his remorse was genuine, his offending was so serious there had to be an immediate jail term. ‘You came into possession of that information by your senior position within the organisation. Your breach of trust was significant,’ he said. ‘Whatever your real motivation was, your actions were deliberate and in my judgment dishonest. You knew at the time what you were doing was illegal. Your actions continued over a three month period and involved a number of individual trades.’ The judge told him: ‘insider dealing is not a victimless crime, harm has been caused by your actions, it has an impact on the overall public confidence in the integrity of the market.’ Coyle, a former Inland Revenue inspector, was a senior and trusted member of the Morrisons executive team.

The spotlight has been shone on the industry's latest marketing statistics - identifying Americans as the most frequent flyers while the busiest route is between Moscow and Nice. Billionaire entrepreneurs, chief executives and A-list celebrities are amongst the exclusive clientele, found to be 80 per cent men. Top ten: Aviation experts NetJets, which has the largest private jet fleet in the world, has listed its top ten routes with passengers . High flyers: A NetJets Europe Phenom Jet 300 comes in to land at London City Airport. London features in three of the top 10 flights . Aviation provider NetJets - which has the largest private jet fleet in the world - announced the findings of the annual report for 2013. Users of the luxury crafts, which often boast private bedrooms, fine-dining facilities and the odd cinema, are typically private entrepreneurs, aged between 40 and 55. The aircraft provider said the United States remains the world’s leading private jet market with 60 per cent of global traffic starting and ending there. Popular routes include Moscow to Côte d’Azur, Miami to New York, New York to Los Angeles, New York to West Palm Beach and London to New York in the most recent data. Typical passengers: American tycoon Donald Trump with daughter Ivanka Trump onboard his private jet as they arrive at Aberdeen Airport last year. Aviation data found flyers are often private entrepreneurs . Lap of luxury: The inside a Global 6000 reveals why those who can afford it are increasingly turning to the pricey form of transport . Europe has the second-largest market for those wanting to avoid the queues, with about a quarter of the US, with Russia representing a significant portion of overall European demand.

She said US businessman were more inclined to use the private transportation as they were 'driven by access' with huge expanses to be covered, often requiring more than one connection. 'If you are a very busy businessman having to connect between flights for meetings, it can be difficult to get where you need to go and at a time you need to be there,' she said. 'In the US there are no business flights and you really don't have the service that you would expect if you are a very busy person. 'With private flights, you can decide what time you want to set off and arrive, at a time that suits the individual and their business needs.' Moscow was among the top 10 routes with highest hours flown in 2013, although the political crisis of late has seen numbers fall by 15 per cent in recent months. No toy: Often seen as a play thing of the rich and the famous like John Travolta pictured, private jets are now regarded as vital business tool . Popular destination: London ranks highly with private jet passengers, according to research by aviation experts NetJets . Elsewhere, private air traffic between London and New York continues to increase year on year with the UK capital accounting for a third of the most frequented routes. Within London, London City Airport has seen significant increases traffic over the last year. The airport is seen as an important hub, particularly for those that work in the financial sector, given its close proximity to Canary Wharf and the city in general. Dubai and the broader UAE are seeing growing traffic although the Middle East’s position as the world’s third-largest market is being challenged by the rise of traffic in China and Brazil. The data showed traffic from Brazil to Europe has grown by a fifth each year since 2010 with the UK, France, Spain and Portugal amongst the most popular destinations. The total business jet market in China still below Europe, estimated at 20,000 flights per year, with potential for significant growth predicted in its domestic flights. Nigeria has also become one of the fastest growing hubs with private departures to and from Lagos. Experts have put the steady global rise down to more travelers rating the plush transport as a vital business tool. Industry figures claim the flights are often cost effective for businessmen, giving them the swift access needed to close deals, often worth huge sums of money. The ability to get anywhere, at any time, can be priceless when it comes to the limited leisure time most customers experience.

{"raw_input": "(CNN)Marvel is going back to war. The massively popular superhero entertainment factory has the third \"Captain America\" movie on the way, \"Civil War,\" which will include Iron Man and quite possibly, the new Spider-Man. It's based on a story arc from almost a decade ago, which tackled issues of freedom versus security, with the two heroes going toe to toe against one another. This summer, Marvel plans to revisit that storyline as part of the much larger return of \"Secret Wars,\" its biggest crossover event of the 1980s. The effects of this will be huge to the comics, ending 33 of the company's titles. CNN spoke to writer Charles Soule, who has gained acclaim for his work on \"Superman/Wonder Woman,\" \"Swamp Thing,\" The Death of Wolverine,\" \"She-Hulk\" and more. He gave us the scoop on the return of \"Civil War,\" one year before it hits the big screen. CNN: What can fans expect from your \"Civil War\" storyline? Soule: \"Secret Wars\" is an opportunity to revisit some of the great Marvel stories of the past. One of those is \"Civil War,\" and I got the call to work on that. \"Civil War\" happened in 2006 and 2007, and in that story Captain America and Iron Man went after each other based on an ideological difference on superheroes in the world. What I'm doing is taking that story in a different direction. CNN: Will this be a way for those who are interested in the upcoming movie to dive into that story? Soule: Absolutely. If you look at the ideas that that story had, Iron Man thought superheroes should have to register with the government, and become something of a police force. Captain America thought that that was restricting the central freedoms of this country. It was a debate of security versus freedom. We're taking that basic idea and expanding it to a larger canvas. The Registration Act is all in the past at this point. It's more of a world drastically changed based on a superhero war, and it's a huge story and it's fun to be able to involve every Marvel character there is. CNN: Is this one of the biggest stories you've worked on? Soule: I've been on big books but this one feels huge. It affects every character in one way or another, and it deals with some central issues to the modern world. That's not always something you get to do in a Marvel story. CNN: So this will have many twists and turns away from the original story? Soule: The idea is to take some of the events in the original storyline and spin them off into entirely new stories. Without spoiling, this deals with a world that has been ravaged for quite some time when we pick up the story. I felt the original \"Civil War\" explored those questions very well. If I was going to play in this sandbox, I wanted to ask my own questions.", "raw_output": "This summer, the popular 1980s \"Secret War\" comic book storyline will return .\nStory will affect every Marvel comic, ending 33 titles .\n2000s \"Civil War\" story will also be revisiting, pitting characters against each other .", "trunc_input": "(CNN)Marvel is going back to war.

David Duckenfield, 70, has admitted his failure to close a tunnel caused dozens of deaths but denied claims he then helped conceal 'very serious professional failings'. The retired chief superintendent from South Yorkshire Police spoke out as he gave evidence for a seventh day at the hearing in Warrington. He admitted that as the man in charge on April 15 1989 'the buck stops with me', but said he was inexperienced and had inherited a safety plan from the previous year. Defence barrister John Beggs QC asked him: 'It has been suggested by some of the barristers sitting in front of me there was some conspiracy to interfere with a fair collection of evidence. Did you have any part in that?' Duckenfield said: 'None at all, sir.' Mr Beggs said: 'Did you know anything about it?' Duckenfield replied: 'I did not'. Mr Beggs asked: 'Did you at any stage even encourage any other police officer or police civilians to change his or her statement?' He said: 'No, sir.' Mr Beggs went on: 'Did you change the content of the statement that the jury know was made by you on or before May 3 1989?' He said: 'No, sir.' Mr Beggs said: 'Did anyone ever ask you to change your statement?' He said: 'No, sir.' He confirmed he had no role in the subsequent investigation by West Midlands Police into the tragedy and had no part either in the direction of the force's case at Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry. Mr Beggs said it had been suggested by a number of barristers at the inquests that Mr Duckenfield alone should bear responsibility for the tragedy. Mr Duckenfield agreed he had nothing to do with previous turnstile 'failures' at Sheffield Wednesday and no one had advised him about them. He had no say on Liverpool being awarded the smaller end of the ground for the match with just 23 turnstiles. In reality, he had 'inherited' the police operation for the match. He also had nothing to do with signage at the ground or previous decisions to install perimeter fences and radial fences, its architectural features or any breaches of stadium safety guidance on crush barrier heights. Mr Beggs asked: 'If supporters turned up later in 1989 than in 1988, for whatever reason, was that something with which you had any control?' 'No sir, ' said Mr Duckenfield. Admissions: David Duckenfield, sketched giving evidence for a seventh day,  admitted he 'froze' during the 1989 football disaster before he ordered the opening of an exit gate to relieve congestion . Tragedy: 96 Liverpool fans were killed in the crush on the overcrowded Leppings Lane terrace in 1989 . Yesterday Duckenfield, 70, said his decisions were a 'direct cause' of the 96 deaths and claimed he 'froze' as the disaster unfolded. He also admitted being unfamiliar with the layout of the Sheffield Wednesday ground and said the FA Cup semi-final in 1989 was his first time in charge of a match. During questioning by Paul Greaney QC, for the Police Federation, he admitted he had caused the deaths of the fans. Mr Duckenfield, who retired in 1991, accepted he 'froze' before ordering the opening of an exit gate to relieve congestion outside the Leppings Lane turnstile. But 2,000 fans then entered Gate C, with many heading straight for the tunnel in front of them which Mr Duckenfield had not ordered to be closed. He said 'yes sir' when asked if the fatal crush would have been avoided if he had closed this tunnel which led to the already packed central terrace pens. Mr Greaney then asked if he had failed to recognise he needed to close the tunnel and Mr Duckenfield again agreed. The inquests continue.

{"raw_input": "Ryanair pilots were forced to wear oxygen masks as they made an emergency landing in Barcelona today after a fire extinguisher went off in the cockpit. Passengers said the pilot and first officer were unable to breathe without the masks as halon - a liquefied, compressed gas - filled the confined space as the plane flew from London Stansted Airport to Valencia. TV presenter and professional sailor Hannah White said that passengers suspected there was a serious problem, but they did not know the reason for the emergency landing until they arrived at Barcelona-El Prat Airport. Ryanair flight FR8321 was met by fire trucks when it landed at Barcelona-El Prat Airport . Hannah spoke to told MailOnline Travel as she and other passengers sat on the plane while the pilot and co-pilot were checked over by medical staff. She said: ‘One of the fire extinguishers in the cockpit went off and it’s got halon gas, which is very dangerous, and as a result the pilot and first officer couldn’t breathe.' Ryanair described it as a minor fault involving a fire extinguisher and said the flight crew followed standard procedure by putting on their masks. Hannah added: ‘The oxygen masks deployed [for the flight crew] and we dropped down to a very low altitude. ‘When [the pilot] came over the tannoy to talk to us you could hear them breathing through the oxygen masks. Passengers said they were unaware of the reason for the emergency landing but knew it was serious . TV presenter and professional sailor Hannah White tweeted a photo of fire trucks on the tarmac . ‘The first thing we heard was “emergency landing”, said three times by the captain, which indicates a massive issue.’ Hannah said the announcement didn’t send immediate panic through the cabin as the passengers had no idea why flight FR8321 was diverting. She said: ‘It was clear that something was wrong. I would have to say the whole situation was dealt with amazingly and professionally.’ One of the flight attendants became anxious and oxygen masks did not deploy for passengers in the cabin, she added. Passengers hailed the crew for their professionalism while the plane diverted to Barcelona . Several passengers tweeted updates while the plane was on the ground and the pilots were checked over . Fire trucks greeted the Boeing 737 when it touched down shortly after 10:15am local time as passengers began to grasp the nature of the emergency. Hannah, 31, said: ‘We had very limited information until we were about to land. It was fairly calm on board, I have to say.’ Once people learned of the reason for the emergency landing they became agitated that they weren’t told sooner, she said. ‘It’s hot [on the plane], and people are pretty keen to get off or find out what’s going on.’ The flight crew declared an emergency over southern France and changed their flight path . Hannah, from London, and her coach were travelling to Valencia for a training session as she prepares to attempt to set a new world record for women’s speed sailing. After the plane had been on the ground for about 30 minutes, passenger Josh Adler tweeted: '@Ryanair it sounds like the faulty equipment has been replaced and you expect us to re-journey soon, thanks again to the pilots and crew.' A Ryanair spokeswoman said: 'This flight from London Stansted to Valencia diverted to Barcelona due to a minor fault with a cockpit fire extinguisher.

{"raw_input": "Virgil van Dijk has hit back at Sean Dillon after the Dundee United skipper said he set out to injure him during the League Cup Final. Dillon required six minutes of treatment, and a number of stitches, after coming off second best in a 50-50 with the Dutchman. To compound his frustration, in his absence, Kris Commons scored the goal which put Ronny Deila’s side on their way to a 2-0 triumph. Dillon was later sent off for a lunge on Emilio Izaguirre but felt justice was not correctly served in his earlier confrontation with van Dijk. ‘I think he left his leg in, I didn’t like it,’ Dillon stated. ‘I get the ball, he gets my leg, and they get a throw-in. So that’s very frustrating. Sean Dillon claimed that Virgil van Dijk tried to injure him during the Scottish League Cup Final . ‘I’m not going to exaggerate it but it’s a big gash, about three inches long maybe, and I needed seven stitches in it.’ But van Dijk hit back at Dillon’s version of events by insisting there was nothing in the challenge. ‘No, never,’ van Dijk countered. ‘I know we are not going to have the same conversations as we had last week but I can honestly say I didn’t do anything wrong. ‘I didn’t leave my foot in, I would never do that on a fellow player.’ Van Dijk had been sent packing by Craig Thompson at Tannadice and only learned on Thursday that he was free to take his place at Hampden. He admitted the uncertainty surrounding the disciplinary case made the build-up to the game far from ideal. Van Dijk helped Celtic on their way to a 2-0 victory at Hampden Park . ‘It was a very good feeling to win the cup, especially after the tough week I had personally,’ said the Dutchman. ‘I was worried after the game last week. I was very stressed and really down. ‘I couldn’t believe I was sent off. I was disappointed with the red card and knew it was going to be a long week even though we said we were going to appeal straight away. ‘You want to know as soon as possible. ‘It was a strange week so I was just happy to be able to play. It would have been very hard to watch it from the stands. ‘This was my first final ever and it was special. We are on our way for the Treble and we want to make history. I wanted to play in the final very badly.’ ‘It gives the manager a boost - but it gives everyone at Celtic a boost. We knew if we were up for it we had a chance to win it. Hopefully we can go on and win the league and Scottish Cup. That’s what we aim to do. Dundee United skipper Dillon saw red later in the game for a foul on Emilio Izaguirre . ‘We know if we are at 100 per cent we can beat everyone in the country. I am very confident we will get the job done.’ Nir Bitton meantime spent the past week nursing fears over the prospect of personal League Cup Final heartbreak. After limping off during the stormy 1-1 Scottish Cup quarter final draw with Dundee United the previous Sunday, the Israeli admits he was slowly coming to terms with the fact he was going to miss the biggest game of his life. That would have been a cruel blow for Bitton, who admits to becoming hooked on Hampden during the 2-0 semi final win over Rangers last month. In the end, however, the prospect of a first cup win of his fledgling career proved the perfect pain relief for his aching ankle. ‘I’ll be honest with you, at the beginning of last week, I didn’t expect to be fit for the Final,’ Bitton said. ‘I trained for the first time on Saturday morning and I was a little bit afraid going into the game. If it was a league game, I may have given the injury a little bit more time to heal. ‘But I pushed it simply because it was a cup final.

{"raw_input": "Arsene Wenger was handed a timely boost ahead of his side's trip to Liverpool this weekend as several first-team players continued their comebacks from injury. England midfielder Jack Wilshere played 45 minutes and opened the scoring in a friendly against Brentford - his first run-out for the team since suffering an injury against Manchester United in November. Club captain Mikel Arteta, also absent since November, managed to get through the first half, while French full back Mathieu Debuchy completed 60 minutes. Jack Wilshere takes on Herson Rodriguez of Brentford as he continued his comeback from injury . England star Wilshere scored the opening goal and created another in a promising return to fitness . Abou Diaby carries the ball out of defence as Mathieu Debuchy (left) and Mikel Arteta (right) look on . Debuchy has struggled with injuries in his first season at the club and is currently recovering from his second serious setback of the season, a shoulder injury sustained against Stoke. Compatriot Mathieu Flamini - who hasn't started a game since February but has been fit enough for the bench in recent weeks - also lasted over an hour, while Abou Diaby managed to play half the match  as he continues his return from yet another injury. Diaby has played just once this season for the first team - in the Capital One Cup - and three games for the Under 21s. He is hoping to prove himself worthy of a new contract after a career blighted with injuries. The quartet could now be available for the visit of Brendan Rodgers' side this weekend. Danny Welbeck, though, remains a doubt after picking up a knee injury during England's win over Lithuania on Friday night. Debuchy, who has struggled since joining Arsenal, has been out since January when he injured his shoulder . Diaby has been blighted by injuries for the best part of a decade and could be about to leave Arsenal . The Frenchman is out of contract in the summer and has played just once for the first team this season . Diaby has had a torrid time with injuries since joining Arsenal but is the club's second-longest serving player . Young midfielder Dan Crowley started alongside Wilshere in midfield, scoring the second goal . There was also a run-out for January signing Krystian Bielik, who is yet to feature for the senior side under Arsene Wenger. But it will be Wilshere's return, coupled with a strong performance, which pleased Wenger most, the 23-year-old marking his comeback with a goal and an assist. The England star put Arsenal ahead after just  seven minutes before playing in promising youngster Dan Crowley for the second 12 minutes later. The Gunners Under 21 striker Alex Iwobi added two more before the break in a comfortable victory.

{"raw_input": "Millionaire Robert Durst was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered a woman in California, as well as drug and weapons charges filed in New Orleans, attorneys said in court papers Friday. In the papers filed at the State Criminal District Court in New Orleans, William Gibbens and Dick DeGuerin asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep Durst jailed. They say he should be released. 'I think he's an easy target and everybody's piling on. ... They're gonna find nothing,\" Dick DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, told  KTRK-TV. 'I think Louisiana and their elected officials want a piece of the publicity pie.' Scroll down for video . 'Invalid arrest': Robert Durst's legal team accused authorities in documents today of arresting the real estate heir illegally, as his attorney blasted Louisiana officials for wanting a piece of the 'publicity pie' 'I think he's an easy target and everybody's piling on ... They're gonna find nothing, Dick DeGuerin (pictured), the lead attorney on Durst's team, said Friday . The judge agreed to schedule that hearing during another court appearance by Durst on Monday in New Orleans. The attorneys also asked the judge to order that evidence be preserved from the hotel where Durst was arrested. They are seeking any and all records related to Durst and Everett Ward, the pseudonym Durst used to check into the hotel. The documents blasted the arrest, which the attorneys say was orchestrated 'to coincide with the final episode of the HBO docudrama The Jinx. The six-part documentary concluded Sunday. Durst, a member of a wealthy New York real estate family, was charged with murder in California for the December 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman. Durst's arrest came shortly before the HBO finale about his links to three killings — that of his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared; and a 71-year-old neighbor in Texas whose dismembered body was found floating in Galveston Bay in 2001. Frail: Durst is on suicide watch at a Louisiana detention center. He is expected to appear in court Monday . Durst has only ever been tried for the Texas killing, and he was acquitted of murder. Durst waived extradition in New Orleans but is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance. Court documents say investigators found nearly $43,000 in cash, a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his hotel room when he was arrested. Authorities have also said marijuana was found in the room. However, Durst's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge. In the case, prosecutors could seek to play portions from The Jinx that concluded with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live. He has been charged in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the 2000 killing Susan Berman, the daughter of a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in New York in 1982. Durst, 71, who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $4 billion, has long denied killing Berman and Kathleen Durst, who was declared dead even though her body was never found. Investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with Berman when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near Beverly Hills. After the killing, Durst disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap Galveston, Texas, boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001. He claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder but was convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man's body, which was found chopped up and floating in Galveston Bay. While legal experts said Durst's remarks off-camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible, prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing. 'I would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials,' said George Fisher, a former prosecutor and professor at Stanford Law School. 'The flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face.' In the case of Blake, prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with Barbara Walters because it contradicted other evidence. The defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview. 'It did a great deal both to humanize him and so he wasn't just seen as a celebrity,' said M. Gerald Schwartzbach, who won Blake's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife. 'There was an image projected that a lot of people had about Robert as a difficult person. In this video, he came across as a very sympathetic person.'

{"raw_input": "The U.S. study showed supplements of of purified Omega 7 oil, the key fatty acid found in anchovies, could reduce harmful blood fats and boost 'good' cholestrol . Anchovies could hold the key to cutting risk factors for heart disease and stroke. An extract of omega oil found in them reduced levels of harmful blood fats and boosted ‘good’ cholesterol. The findings come from the first human trial of supplements of purified Omega 7 oil, the key fatty acid found in anchovies. After just a month volunteers were found to have a 44 per cent cut in C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation in the blood, along with triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol. Experts say the health benefits of palmitoleic acid, the prime Omega 7 acid, are only just emerging. Dr Michael Roizen, who led the US study, said ‘I think the major benefit come from decreasing inflammation as well as a beneficial effect on other contributing risk factors to cardiovascular disease, with no side effects that we know of.’ Dr Roizen, professor of medicine and head of the Wellness Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, said ‘The trial showed inflammatory markers were reduced and the effect on good fats was a bonus. ‘There seems to be a lot of benefit and not much risk – this could help us tackle some of the factors made worse by obesity that can lead to heart disease,’ he added. In the study, 60 adult volunteers were randomly assigned to take 220mg of palmitoleic acid once a day or an inactive supplement for 30 days. Those taking part had mildly raised levels of blood fats and inflammation. After the study tests showed a 44 per cent reduction in CRP, 15 per cent cut in triglycerides and eight per cent fall in LDL cholesterol – all factors linked to heart disease. Levels of HDL – a good form of cholesterol – rose five per cent compared with those taking dummy capsules. The trial, published by the Journal of Clinical Lipidology, was funded by Tersus Pharmaceuticals which provided the experimental capsules called Provinal. Provinal is available in the UK as Pura 7, a new brand of Omega 7 concentrated wild anchovy oil. Unlike the better known polyunsaturated fatty acids known as omega-3s, omega-7s are monounsaturated fats and they have different mechanisms of action. But to get the same effect from anchovies alone would mean eating a can of the fish a day . Palmitoleic acid was found by scientists at Harvard University in 2008 to be the first fatty acid to act as a hormone in the body. It plays an important role in regulating metabolism and appears to protect against harmful processes associated with obesity-related diseases such as diabetes. Dr Roizen, who chairs the scientific advisory board for Tersus Pharmaceuticals, said people would have to eat around a can of anchovies a day to get the same amount of omega 7 oil from a daily dose of supplements. ‘That’s a reasonable amount of anchovies every day if you like them, but some people find it simpler and more convenient to take supplements’ he added.

{"raw_input": "When it comes to the FA Cup, Manchester United have edged Barclays Premier League rivals Arsenal in recent years, winning three of their last five meetings. This year, the pair have been pitted against each other once again, in the quarter-finals - the difference this time being that Sir Alex Ferguson will not be in charge of United. Can Arsenal, the current holders, balance the scales and reach the last four? Manchester United will face Arsenal in the FA Cup for the first time since Sir Alex Ferguson's (right) retirement . Manchester United 0 Arsenal 2 - FA Cup fifth-round, February 2003 . Goals either side of half-time saw Arsenal bag a comfortable win over their top-flight rivals. Edu opened the scoring for the Gunners in the 34th minute with a free-kick which deflected off the shoulder of David Beckham and wrong-footed Fabien Barthez. The visitors struck another blow to United's comeback hopes when Sylvain Wiltord took the ball around Wes Brown before converting a well-placed shot for Arsenal's second in the 52nd minute, putting the game out of reach.

Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs has an attempt at goal during the FA Cup fifth-round in 2004 . Arsenal 0 Manchester United 1 - FA Cup semi-final, April 2004 . United secured their place in the final by beating Arsenal at Villa Park, where Paul Scholes fired home the only goal. It came just after half an hour when Ryan Giggs squared a ball in from the right to an unmarked Scholes, whose fierce shot sailed past Jens Lehmann. Arsenal did have their chances, however, with Edu and Patrick Vieira both hitting the woodwork and frequently forcing Roy Carroll into action. The defeat ended the Gunners' 18-match unbeaten FA Cup run, which stretched back to their 2001 defeat to Liverpool in the final. United playmaker Paul Scholes (centre) scores the only goal as his side beat Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final . United winger Cristiano Ronaldo (left) is brought down by Arsenal defender Gael Clichy (right) Arsenal 0 Manchester United 0 (Arsenal win 5-4 on penalties) - FA Cup final, May 2005 . Arsenal held on for a goalless draw after a dominant Manchester United performance in the Wembley final, which the Gunners went on to win 5-4 on penalties. United were unable to beat in-form goalkeeper Lehmann, who made crucial saves throughout before saving Scholes' penalty to clinch the cup. United came close with chances from Wayne Rooney, who hit the post, and Ruud van Nistlerooy, whose effort was deflected onto the bar by Freddie Ljungberg. Come the shoot-out, Arsenal, who had Jose Antonio Reyes sent off in the final minute of extra-time, maintained their composure and scored all five penalties, the fifth converted by Vieira.

A dominant first-half performance saw Manchester United ease to victory over Arsenal in the fifth round. United were 3-0 up by half-time thanks to headed efforts by Rooney and Darren Fletcher which effectively put the game out of reach after 20 minutes, with Nani netting a third just before the break. The Gunners' luck worsened shortly after the restart when Emmanuel Eboue was sent off for a foul on Patrice Evra, ruling out any glimmer of a comeback. The match was finally put to bed in the 74th minute when Fletcher headed in his second and United's fourth.

The immediate concern is just to win some matches.’ Tony Mowbray issues instructions from the touchline during his first game in charge of Coventry . Coventry's Jim O'Brien opens the scoring for the home side in just the fourth minute of the match . For Mowbray, who arrived at the club last week, Coventry City is a club of heritage and romance.

He has vowed to take them back there, to their ‘rightful place’. The reality is very different. Today, Hill’s bronze statue stands outside a superstore for the rugby club Wasps, whose amber and black logo looms over the main entrance. They own the place; Coventry City are strangers in their own home, seeking to get out in the next few years. The Ricoh Arena is magnificent, ready for the top flight. But few thought that would mean Premiership rugby union rather than Premier League football. Confidence has drained, crowds are down. When the club returned from their exile in Northampton 35 miles away back in September, over 27,000 packed into the ground. On Saturday, a mere 9,446 turned out. The potential for massive crowds is obvious but poor form has seen many return their scarves to the back of the wardrobe.

It’s because Coventry are staring at the indignity of fourth-tier football for the first time since 1959 and, after this chastening reintroduction to management after 16 months away, Mowbray is in no doubt as to how precarious their situation is. ‘If we’d sat here and we’d won, I’d be telling you how great it was but as a football manager it really hurts,’ he reflected. ‘The highs are really good, the lows low but there’s not much in between. ‘It would have been nice to give the fans a victory. I don’t think the players let them down but we are where we are.’ To be exact, still a sole point above the relegation zone after an afternoon that had started so positively for his team.

Tom Pope and then the impressive Mark Marshall, released by Mowbray’s predecessor Steven Pressley in the summer, exposed defensive flaws. But Coventry rallied and when Sanmi Odelusi came off the bench to level, they had all the momentum with 20 minutes to play. Alas, six minutes later, Michael O’Connor’s free-kick handed the three points to Vale, who are just two points off the play-offs. Their manager, Rob Page, made 70 league appearances for Coventry as a defender.

{"raw_input": "Positive message: The Chancellor, pictured today in Tilbury, has portrayed Britain as ‘the comeback country’ with better times ahead . George Osborne yesterday used his final Budget before the election to help savers, low earners and homebuyers. Seizing on a run of excellent economic news, the Chancellor portrayed Britain as ‘the comeback country’ with better times ahead. He sought to blunt Labour’s lines of attack – notably on living standards – by declaring that families will be £900 better off this year than they were in 2010. By easing back his austerity plans to match the level of state spending under Tony Blair in 2000, he rubbished the Opposition’s apocalyptic warnings of a return to the 1930s. Tax cuts will be paid for in part by a £5billion double strike on the banks. Mr Osborne put thrift and home ownership at the heart of his nakedly political statement and said the ‘sun is starting to shine’. He delighted Tory MPs with a surprise announcement that 95 per cent of savers – many of them pensioners punished by years of low interest rates – are to be freed from paying tax on their life savings. A new personal savings allowance will mean they can earn up to £1,000 in interest without paying tax. With most accounts paying around 1 per cent, this would mean nest-eggs of up to £100,000 would be exempt. Other measures in Mr Osborne’s sixth Budget included: . Mr Osborne also sought to dispel perceptions that the Tories were friends of the rich by cutting pension tax relief for the best-off. With just 50 days to go to the election, he allowed himself a pat on the back for ‘historic’ jobs figures, published ahead of the Budget. There are now 30.9million people in work – an all-time high – with the coalition overseeing the creation of 1,600 jobs a day over the past year. Revealed: Mail analysis of the budget reveals how tax and National Insurance changes from April will affect your income from April . Debate: Sky News host Eamonn Holmes took the Chancellor to task in a series of post-Budget interviews given this morning . The public sector payroll is down to 5.4million, or 17 per cent of the workforce, a record low. But in a significant rebalancing of the economy, there are 2.3million more in private sector jobs than 2010. While Labour’s Ed Miliband had wanted the UK to follow the policy measures of socialist France, the British economy was now growing at seven times its rate, Mr Osborne said.Scroll down for video . And though Labour had claimed austerity measures would mean a million more unemployed, the ‘great county’ of Yorkshire had created more jobs than the whole of France on its own. ‘The sun is starting to shine – and we are fixing the roof,’ the Chancellor told MPs. ‘We took difficult decisions in the teeth of opposition and it worked. Britain is walking tall again. ‘Five years ago, our economy had suffered a collapse greater than almost any country. Today, I can confirm: in the last year we have grown faster than any other major advanced economy in the world. ‘The critical choice facing the country now is this: do we return to the chaos of the past? Or do we say to the British people, let’s work through the plan that is delivering for you? ‘We choose the future. Our goal is for Britain to become the most prosperous economy in the world.’ George Osborne, pictured holding up his Budget briefcase for the cameras outside 11 Downing Street, yesterday used his final Budget before the election to help savers, low earners and homebuyers . Labour leader Mr Miliband said Mr Osborne had ‘failed working families’ and stuck to his claim that households are on average £1,600 a year worse off . Mr Osborne hailed better than expected growth figures, which suggest the economy will expand by 2.5 per cent this year. He also announced that the Government had met its target set in 2010 to see national debt falling as a share of national income by the time of the next election. The Chancellor said the beneficial effect on the public finances of lower inflation, plus a sell-off of a chunk of mortgage debts nationalised in the financial crisis, meant he could pay down some of Britain’s vast debt pile. He also said he would end the squeeze on public spending a year earlier than planned. By 2019, public spending would be growing again in line with the economy. Acknowledging the pain of years of austerity, the Chancellor said ‘the hard work and sacrifice of the British people has paid off’. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility said public spending faces a ‘rollercoaster’ ride, with tough cuts between 2016 and 2018 followed by a surge in spending at the end of the decade. Labour leader Mr Miliband said Mr Osborne had ‘failed working families’ and stuck to his claim that households are on average £1,600 a year worse off. ‘This is a Budget that people won’t believe from a government that is not on their side,’ Mr Miliband told MPs. ‘Five years ago, what did the Chancellor say – “we will balance the books in five years”. No ifs, no buts – just like the immigration pledge. The only thing long term about his plan is that it will take twice as long to balance the books. That is the reality.’ Though the Tories have vowed to maintain protection for the NHS budget, Mr Miliband claimed they must have a ‘secret plan’ to cut it because ‘colossal’ cuts to other areas of spending would not otherwise be deliverable.

{"raw_input": "This is the heartstopping moment when a biker swerved within inches of a HGV during a high speed police chase which reached speeds of almost 150mph. Paul Roberts, 43, was seen weaving wildly between three lanes of rush-hour traffic with a passenger on his high-powered Kawasaki ZZR 1400 motorbike during the pursuit last September. The incredible footage, filmed by an unmarked police officer, shows Roberts come within inches of an HGV, then accelerate to speeds in excess of 148mph along the southbound M11 near Chigwell in Essex. Incredible footage filmed by an unmarked police officer in pursuit shows Paul Roberts come within inches of an HGV, then accelerate to speeds in excess of 148mph . His top speed is believed to be the highest ever recorded in the UK by a rider carrying a pillion passenger, the force said. When confronted over his potentially deadly driving, he replied: 'I know it's not an excuse, but I knew they wouldn't get out of the way.' Roberts, who runs a taxi firm in London, admitted dangerous driving at Chelmsford Crown Court and was banned from the road for 15 months. Recorder Colin Chandler said: 'Weaving in and out of traffic and undertaking, even within the speed limit, is what people would call 'hairy'. 'When it is done at speeds of up to and over 100mph - it can only be described as outrageous and nothing less. 'You are lucky that no one in this case was hurt or injured.' The court heard how Roberts had been speeding to work at around 7.30am on September 12 last year when he was seen by PC Paul Hills during a motorbike patrol to cut down on rush hour collisions. PC Hills pursued the reckless biker at speeds of up to 148mph but took four miles of road to catch Roberts. Geoffrey Porter, prosecuting, said: 'You will see the defendant weaving in between traffic and undertaking cars in lane three and two. 'When not doing that, he is accelerating. The dangerous motorcyclist had shot past the unmarked police car whop began the high speed chase of Roberts . After dodging between a HGV and car, the rider was filmed by officers in the unmarked police car in pursuit pulling in front of a car . 'He also is seen to pass between vehicles in heavy traffic. 'The officer describes it as 'making himself and his passenger the meat in a sandwich'. 'The highest speed recorded by PC Hills is up to 148mph. 'In his opinion, he was not making ground on the motorcycle being ridden by the defendant at this speed.' When spoken to about his speeding, he told the officer: 'I know it's not an excuse, but I knew they wouldn't get out of the way.' Roberts, from Harlow, Essex, pleaded guilty to one count of dangerous driving at an earlier hearing. He had been told he could face up to two years in prison before his sentencing today. The father-of-two claimed he had accelerated as he was carrying thousands of pounds in cash and cheques on his bike and feared he was being chased by the unmarked cop. The rider then accelerates to 148mph- the fastest speed recorded by police for a motorcyclist carrying a passenger . Roberts was later seen weaving in between two cars along the southbound M11 near Chigwell in Essex . Kenneth Aylett, mitigating, said: 'The officer was not in a marked vehicle and was plain clothed. 'With an unmarked bike trailing him for a while he began to worry he was being trailed for the money.' Roberts was banned from driving for 15 months and will have to complete an extended driving test before being allowed back on the roads. He was also fined £400 costs and ordered to pay a £60 victim surcharge as well as completing 120 hours unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order. Outside court, Sgt Nick Edwards, who runs the Essex Police motorcycle unit, said: 'This is probably the highest speed recorded in Essex and is also the highest recorded in the UK with a pillion passenger. Roberts was recorded weaving wildly between three lanes of rush-hour traffic on his high-powered Kawasaki ZZR 1400 motorbike . 'It is only through good fortune no injuries or deaths were caused by his driving that day. I'm satisfied with the severity of the sentence. 'The fact that imprisonment was considered as an option is welcomed.' Sergeant Nick Edwards, from the force's motorcycle unit, said: 'The levels of harm to which Paul Roberts subjected himself, his pillion passenger, the public and my officer are just beyond comprehension. 'These speeds are for race tracks not public roads. This riding behaviour will not be tolerated on Essex roads and the court have clearly recognised the consequences of the rider's actions in the punishment that has been awarded.'", "raw_output": "Paul Roberts, 43, was filmed weaving wildly between rush-hour traffic .\nPolice followed his high-powered Kawasaki ZZR 1400 along M11  in Essex .\nPursuit footage shows him accelerate to speeds in excess of 148mph .\nRoberts claimed he thought plain clothed officers were trying to rob him .\nHe avoided jail after admitting dangerous driving but got a 15 month ban .", "trunc_input": "This is the heartstopping moment when a biker swerved within inches of a HGV during a high speed police chase which reached speeds of almost 150mph.

{"raw_input": "Beijing (CNN)Native to a remote region of China, this tiny mammal, known as the Ili pika, doesn't know it's a member of an endangered species --  and neither do most people. Rarer -- and some would argue cuter-- than the panda, there are less than 1,000 of these teddy bear-like creatures living in the Tianshan mountain range in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China, says conservationist Li Weidong. Li discovered the pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, in 1983 and named it after his hometown, Ili. Last July, Li spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s. He estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70% since its discovery. \"I discovered the species, and I watched as it became endangered,\" he told CNN. \"If it becomes extinct in front of me, I'll feel so guilty.\" In 2008, the animal was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature but there's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it, according to Li. The mammal, only 20 centimeters long, lives on sloping bare rock faces and feeds on grasses at high elevations. Li says the pika's habitat has been affected by global warming. Due to rising temperatures, glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the Tianshan mountains, forcing the pikas to gradually retreat to mountain tops, Li said. Ili pikas were originally found at elevations between 3,200 to 3,400 meters, he said. Now they have retreated to elevations of 4,100 meters. \"They have nowhere else to retreat,\" he added. It's also a solitary animal and is not as vocal as other pika species, so if predators are near, Ili pikas are not able to alert each other, Li said. Disease may also be a factor in its decline. In 1983, when Li first came across the mammal, nobody knew what it was. Two years later, Li  found another two and it was declared a new species. In the decade following, Li and his colleagues conducted a number of studies, including a census at 14 different sites. However, in 1992, Li left Ili to work with Xinjiang Academy of Environmental Protection in the regional capital Urumqi. No studies were conducted on Ili pika in the following decade. No one saw the pika, either. In 2002 and 2003, Li,  with a team of volunteers, conducted a fresh census. Despite spending 37 days searching the mountains for the pikas on seven separate trips, they came up empty handed. However, by analyzing droppings and snow tracks, Li, along with Arizona State University biologist Andrew Smith, was able to conclude that the Ili pika population had seen a dramatic decline. Together they calculated that there might be 2,000 mature animals, down from 2,900 in the early 1990s. The research, published in 2005, recommended that the animal should be listed as endangered. In 2007, Li retired early to throw himself into searching for the pika. Last year, he organized a group of 20 volunteers to conduct another survey with infrared cameras. This time, on the second day of the field trip, they finally spotted a pika, who jumped and stepped over Li's feet while he was trying to photograph it. The volunteers dubbed it a \"magic rabbit.\" They concluded that there were fewer than 1,000 Ili pikas, said Li. \"This tiny species could be extinct any time,\" he said. \"They don't exist in the sites where they used to be anymore.\" Li funds the research with himself, along with donations and occasional grants from organizations like the World Wide Fund for Nature. He says he has spent more than $32,000 of his own money over the past three decades and he has to raise funds to pay for gas. But what upsets Li most isn't the lack of funding. It's the lack of official recognition for the Ili, and other pikas' plight. The Ili pika isn't included on China's List of Wildlife under Special State Protection -- part of the country's 1988 Wildlife Protection Law. The Department for Wildlife and Forest Plants Protection, under the Ministry of Forestry, said it was in the process of updating the list but declined to give any further details. Li and his volunteers have been calling for the establishment of a nature reserve to help protect the animal. \"I'm almost 60, and soon I won't be able to climb the Tianshan Mountains,\" he said. \"So I really hope that an organization will have people study and protect the Ili Pika.\"", "raw_output": "There are less than 1000 Ili pikas in existence, says Li Weidong .\nIt was photographed for the first time in two decades last year .", "trunc_input": "Beijing (CNN)Native to a remote region of China, this tiny mammal, known as the Ili pika, doesn't know it's a member of an endangered species --  and neither do most people.

After the men burst into the store, both with their faces covered, one of them failed to get behind the counter. The second man guarded the door but fled when Mr Dhillon ignored the danger and pounced on the first man from behind. The man burst into the shop with his hood up and a scarf covering his face, as another guarded the door . The pair fell against shelves in the  store, knocking items to the ground. Mr Dhillon managed to force the man to the floor where he placed him in a stranglehold - while the other man fled. Meanwhile, Mr Dhillon's wife, Sam, 40, arrived and used her son's baseball bat to help further subdue the man until police arrived. Ms Brighty also helped restrain him. Sab Dhillon heard the exchange and pounded on the man from behind, in a bid to subdue him . After a brief scuffle Mr Dhillon managed to wrestle the masked man to the floor and subdue him . Mrs Dhillon   came out to the store, armed with a baseball bat to subdue the man as the assistant held the door . Mr Dhillon said: 'I was in the back of the shop on the computer and I noticed two lads walk in and then I heard Andrea shouting. 'I saw the axe and I just ran at him and we ended up having a scuffle. 'The whole thing was pure instinct, I didn't have time to think. 'I think everyone imagines these situations when they work in retail but you never think it will actually happen to you. 'To be honest I am a little bit surprised by my own actions and I can't believe I did what I did. 'I had him round the neck and I just held him there until the police arrived. 'I managed to get the axe off him. 'I put him in a choke hold, again instinctively, I don't know why I thought of that. 'I just wanted to protect my staff and make sure that no of them get hurt. We have been here for five years, there has been a couple of minor incidents but nothing at this level. Mrs Dhillon said the incident had made them more cautious especially late at night. She said: 'My husband's brave for what he did. He put his life in danger and it was scary.' Shaun Andrew McKerry, 31, of Coundon, near Bishop Auckland, has been charged with attempted robbery. He has been remanded in custody to appear at Durham Crown Court on March 31. A knife-wielding raider burst into a newsagents in South Tyneside and threatened staff. The man burst into the store at about 9.30am on Tuesday, brandishing a blade. He left empty-handed but made off with two other men. Staff were left shaken but unharmed by the incident. Police are appealing for witnesses and looking for the two men who were outside the shop while the incident took place. A 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and is currently in custody. Anyone with information should contact police on 101, extension 69191, quoting log number 216 of 17/03/15 or ring Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

{"raw_input": "IT consultant-turned-travel blogger, Tom Ayzenberg, sure knows a thing or two when it comes to packing lightly. In this viral video, which has been viewed over eight million times, the Birmingham, Michigan native, demonstrates a bundled wrapping method of packing - otherwise known as 'clown car style'. 'I'm going to pack all this stuff into this bag,' he says at the beginning of the video, displaying a month's worth of jeans, shorts, and t-shirts alongside a small backpack-like carry-on bag. IT consultant-turned-travel blogger, Tom Ayzenberg, demonstrates his bundle wrapping packing method . The 28-year-old explains that he had learned this particular packing hack from his mother. Since the video first was uploaded, Ayzenberg has since gone on to become a successful travel blogger with his site, 'I'm Flying Around the Country.' To replicate Tom's space-saving method, first lay all of your clothes out flat, with trouser legs and shirt arms hanging out of the bag. Then, fold them on top of one another, tucking them in as you go. His minute-and-a-half long video has been viewed over eight million times on YouTube . To replicate Tom's space-saving method, first lay all your clothes out flat with trouser legs hanging out . Then, fold them on top of each other, tightly packing them in as you go to ensure that they won't wrinkle . Want even more space-saving inspiration? We talked to A Lady in London travel blogger, Julie Falconer, to get her in-the-know secrets: . 1. Rolling clothes is key to saving space. 2. Opt for travel sizes of your favourite toiletries. 3. Only bring one pair of shoes. 4. Swap your larger noise-cancelling headphones for an in-ear style. While it may be a bit confusing at first, Ayzenberg's video does offer a pretty easy-to-understand step-by-step display of the process. Never again will you have to decide between your two favourite pairs of jeans during a quick mini-break holiday. In fact, you'll even be able to fit in a full-size beach towel if you play your cards right. Best of all, by packing the clothes in so tightly, not only will you save loads of space, but there's also a far lesser chance that your clothes will arrive at your destination full of wrinkles.

{"raw_input": "Diagnosed with breast cancer, Sara Cutting faced the prospect of losing her curly blonde hair during the rigours of chemotherapy. But rather than let it get to her, she decided to embrace baldness by taking a selfie every day – and showing off a spectacular hat each time.

She then uploads smiling selfies to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, where she has thousands of followers. And to cap it all, the idea has helped raise £9,000 for MacMillan Cancer Support. Now on day 142 of the challenge, her treatment has finished and her hair is starting to grow back – but she has decided that she likes being bald and plans to stay that way. ‘Life has to go on and you have to find a way of coping, so this has been a really good focus for me,’ she said. ‘It’s a reason for me to get my make up on, get dressed and put on a big smile, no matter how I’m feeling.’ Miss Cutting, who runs a building and renovation company in Brighton, said the experience has been ‘liberating’. Her selfies have generated many fans online, with offers of ideas coming in from as far as Australia. And she has already worn hats by designer Philip Treacy, who was behind many of the creations worn at the Royal Wedding in 2011. Miss Cutting, who was diagnosed with cancer last summer and began chemotherapy in October, begins a four-week course of radiotherapy next week. She hopes her challenge will help raise awareness and prompt others to check for signs of the disease. Donations can be made on Sara's JustGiving page.

Three-hundreds Chinese villagers have signed a petition demanding the return of a 1,000-year-old relic containing a mummified monk. They believe that the Buddha statue on display in Holland is the same that was stolen from Spring Village, Fujian, in 1995, the People's Daily Online reports. Now they are calling on Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, to hand back their 'ancestral patriarch', Buddhist Zhanggong Liuquan. The letter states: 'In our hearts he is not a cultural display item to be placed in a museum but a living Buddha that is respected and revered by us all. 'This is a tradition that is deeply important to our way of life. He has looked over us for over 1000 years and is a testament to our historical and cultural heritage.' Locals say Zhanggong Liuquan did many good things for villagers such as curing illnesses free of charge. When he died, people made his body a statue before the body rotted, and then they placed the body in the memorial hall of the village ever since. The Buddhist has become a spiritual sustenance for locals. The statue was first displayed in Drents Museum in the Netherlands in 2014, causing the Cultural Relics Bureau to launch an investigation. Scroll down for video . They found photographs and historical records that supported the claim that it in fact belonged to a temple in the village. A Buddha statue (left) containing a mummified monk (right) was actually stolen from a village temple twenty years ago, Chinese experts believe . The private owner, who wants to stay anonymous, bought the relic in 1996 at a European market. The mummified remains were discovered at the end of February after he took the statue to the museum in the Netherlands to be restored. According to various Chinese media, the Dutch collector said he is willing to return the Buddha statue if it is proved to be the one stolen from Fujian. The mummified remains were discovered at the end of February after a private owner took the statue to Drents Museum at the Meander Medical Centre in the Netherlands for restoration. Above, the museum completes a CT scan . Erik Bruijn, an Buddhism expert, determined the mummy dated back to the 11th or 12th century and was Buddhist master Liuquan.

Then spare a thought for Diane Cowan who has been stranded on a island off Maine for more than a month thanks to heavy ice. With no helicopter available to pull her out and crossing the mile stretch to the mainland on foot or in a vehicle too dangerous, marine biologist Cowan has been running low on supplies. Iced-in on Friendship Long Island for the past 32 days, Cowan was delivered from hunger pangs by friends who chartered a plane to drop food and supplies for her and her dog, as the winter shows no signs of ending anytime soon. Having spent the past 15-years on the island where her nonprofit Lobster Conservancy has a six-acre lobster pond, Cowan, 54, has said this winter is by far the worst she has known. 'I've been iced in for 32 days,' said Cowan to USA Today. 'The longest I've been trapped on the island before was two weeks.' 'I still don't know how much longer I'll be stuck here,' she said. Boats have been unable to leave Friendship Harbor for three weeks after this years painful winter that has seen temperatures rarely rise above freezing. While Cowan doesn't have running water she does have her dog, phone, a stove, electricity and the Internet. However, her friends began to worry about her and organized a care package which they dropped in by plane. All alone: Diane Cowan is seen here from the plane hired by her friends to air drop supplies to Friendship Long Island over the weekend . Relief is on the way: Friends of Diane Cowan load up their plane with coffee and fresh meat and dog food . Friends to the rescue: Bob Lary - shoving the first box out the window  while the temperatures stood at minus 10 degrees . Remote: Diane Cowan is currently working on Friendship Long Island - which is visible in this picture as the furthest speck on the archipelago . They loaded three boxes with food and hired a pilot to fly over the two mile long and half-mile wide island so they could get low enough to drop the boxes safely. The temperature was a chilly minus 12 degrees when they made the drop. 'The pilot was awesome,' said Bob Lary to USA Today. 'He did a couple of flyovers and got his bearings, (then) opened the window and said, 'Chuck it.' And I did, twice.' While the first box hit the roof of one of the buildings on the island, the second one made a perfect landing. 'I was thrilled, absolutely thrilled,' said Cowan to the Bangor Daily News. 'And I also like the idea this could be done because it gives a whole new dimension to getting stuff out here longer term.' Diane usually stocks up with two months of food to be on the safe side when she departs for the winter and keeps herself warm with a wood fire and solar panels for electricity. But next year she says she is going to bring along a small box of treats which she will label, 'Don't open until February', just to be on the safe side.

{"raw_input": "When England crashed out of the last global limited-overs tournament there was just the small matter of a dead rubber against the Netherlands to complete what had been a hugely disappointing World Twenty20. Fast forward 10 months and here we are again amid more recriminations over another lost campaign and a final match, this time against Afghanistan, where England have far more to lose than just a meaningless group match. Ashley Giles will not need reminding that a dispirited England lost to Holland in Bangladesh and any hope he had of becoming head coach disappeared along with their chances of making an impact on yet another world stage. England coach Peter Moores and batting coach Mark Ramprakash watch over training on Wednesday . The World Cup flops form a huddle on the Sydney Cricket Ground as they prepare to face Afghanistan . Indications are Peter Moores will keep his job, at least for the Test series in the Caribbean, whatever happens at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday morning but the last thing he needs is another humiliating loss against another of the ‘minnows.’ The fact England turned up early on Wednesday for what used to be known as naughty boy nets and had a full training session said everything about their desperate need to take something, anything, from their worst ever World Cup. England are the laughing stock of world cricket again and there is no body of people who enjoy that scenario more than an Australian nation who cannot believe their luck that the old enemy have gone out of their World Cup so soon. Moores (centre back) looks set to keep his job at least until after the Test series in the West Indies . Victory against an Afghanistan side who have made a remarkable journey from the refugee camps of Pakistan to be here would barely regain any pride for an England team who are still coming to terms with what they have done. But for Moores it would perhaps keep the wolves away from his door for just a short while before he helps put the finishing touches to a squad for the three-Test series in the West Indies next month that will be named on Tuesday. England will be without Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, two players who can still expect a one-day future, when they face Afghanistan and it is far from certain that both will be able to take their places on the plane to St Kitts on April 2. Moeen strained an abdominal muscle when bowling in the fateful defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide while Woakes has a ‘stress reaction’ in his third metatarsal of his left foot. Both will be assessed when England get home. Senior England paceman Stuart Broad warms up with a rugby ball on the SCG during their session in the sun . In their absence it is to be hoped England give games to the two players yet to appear in this World Cup in James Tredwell and Ravi Bopara, not least before both could then be making their final one-day international appearances. If England are serious about ever making an impact in one-day cricket they have to start from scratch after this tournament with a squad full of players who will be at or near their peak in 2019. That means there is little point in them persevering in 50-over cricket beyond Friday with the likes of Tredwell, Bopara and the senior trio of Ian Bell, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson, who yesterday insisted he wants to play on. A dead rubber against Afghanistan is hardly the way all of them would have wanted to bow out but at least they will be meeting a team with an identical World Cup record as themselves – just a single victory against Scotland. There was a familiar figure at the helm of the Afghan team at the SCG yesterday in the avuncular form of coach Andy Moles, the former Warwickshire batsman who has ignored security advice to work in Kabul. History repeating? England will be eager to avoid a repeat to their loss to Netherlands (pictured) in their World T20 group dead rubber when the same scenario is presented to them on Friday against Afghanistan . Moles has been in charge of a team who have defeated England before – when he coached New Zealand in the Champions Trophy – and would have no qualms about piling on the misery for his homeland. ‘England are not in the best of nick and we still believe we’ve got a scare in us in this World Cup, especially if we show composure at the top of the order,’ said Moles. ‘If we hold our nerve and are at our best we can pull off a shock. ‘I’m obviously sad to see England’s demise but I’m delighted to be here with Afghanistan. We’ve had some great learning experiences, had our first win and gave Sri Lanka a scare. This has been a shop window for Afghan cricket and I think we’ve made friends. We play with a freedom that I’ve tried to enhance.’ It is the ability to play with freedom that has been so badly lacking in England’s cricket but they have one more chance to get it right before they slink off on an early flight home. Otherwise they will lose as many friends as the Afghans have gained.", "raw_output": "England face Afghanistan with more to lose than a World Cup dead rubber .\nThey must avoid another shocking loss to minnows after Dutch T20 defeat .\nEngland are reeling while the Afghan's journey to be here is remarkable .\nPeter Moores looks set to keep job at least until after series in West Indies .\nEngland went through full training session in Sydney on Wednesday .\nMoeen Ali and Chris Woakes will miss Afghanistan match through injury .", "trunc_input": "When England crashed out of the last global limited-overs tournament there was just the small matter of a dead rubber against the Netherlands to complete what had been a hugely disappointing World Twenty20.

{"raw_input": "For most of her life young Queensland woman Samantha Geldenhuys thought she was an ordinary Australian girl with a loving mum and younger brother living in a beachside suburb of Townsville. Then the Australian Federal Police came knocking on the door of the family home and arrested Sam's mother. That was when the pretty young blonde learned she was the subject of one of America’s longest running child kidnapping cases, and that her mother's real name was Dorothy Barnett and that she was an international fugitive wanted by US federal authorities. And that over in South Carolina a wealthy stockbroker by the name of Benjamin Harris Todd III had never given up hope of finding her - and that Sam's birth name was Savanna Todd. 'She just took me and ran,' Sam told Channel Seven. 'She started anew just for me.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Confused: For 20 years Samantha Geldenhuys (pictured) thought she was an ordinary young woman, but then police came and arrested her mother at their Townsville home and Sam learned she was the centre of America’s longest running child kidnapping case and her Mum was an international fugitive . Never gave up hope: Savanna's father Benjamin Todd II (pictured with his baby daughter in 1994) never stopped hoping his kidnapped daughter would be found and each year updated her room and made a video for each of her birthdays . Dorothy Lee Barnett pictured with baby Savanna kidnapped her daughter after a bitter custody battle and absconded to South Africa and eventually Australia where she lived as a fugitive under an assumed name until her lie unravelled following a slip of the tongue while drinking with friends . The only father she knew: Savanna, pictured as a toddler, was renamed Samantha. She is in the arms of the man she thought was her father, her stepfather, Juan Geldenhuys, who later died before Samantha learned the incredible truth about her past . Another life: Samantha pictured with the mother she knew as Alex Geldenhuys, whose real name was revealed as Dorothy Barnett following her dramatic arrest in Queensland last year and deportation back to a US Jail . It was a lot to take in the blur that followed. Sam's mother made several appearances during extradition hearings in a Queensland court before Ms Barnett was finally deported to the US and immediately placed in prison. Channel Seven's Sunday Night programme accompanied Ms Geldenhuys to the US for a tearful reunion with her mother and to attend 53-year-old Ms Barnett's trial on Parental Kidnapping and US Passport Fraud charges, for which she is now serving prison time. The dramatic events of Sam's past began on an access visit in 1994, when Dorothy Barnett did not return baby Savanna to Benjamin Todd and the two disappeared. Samantha and her real father Benjamin Todd III pictured together just months before Savanna disappeared. Following her parents' separation her father was awarded full custody of Savanna . A still from footage of baby Savanna before her kidnapping by her mother, who was only allowed supervised acess to her daughter after a court case in which Benjamin Todd III alleged Barnett was bipolar . Samantha and her mother not long after fleeing. Todd and Barnett had been engaged in a bitter custody battle, but each side has different reasons for the failure of their doomed relationship . Savanna now named Samantha with stepfather Juan and mother Dorothy, now known as Alex, in South Africa . A young Samantha who insists she had a loving, stable upbringing and that her mother was nothing but loving, doting on herself and her younger half-brother, who's father is Samantha's late stepfather Juan . Samantha last year after learning the truth about her past . Todd and Barnett had been engaged in a bitter custody battle, but each side has different reasons for the failure of their doomed relationship. Benjamin Todd II was a softly spoken 'southern gentleman' and classical music lover, the son of a nurse and a doctor from Kentucky who entered a career working at financial management company Merrill Lynch in Charleston, South Carolina. Dorothy Lee Barnett, had been raised by a single mother and stepfather on welfare, and had travelled extensively, running a piggery in Belize, a jewellery business in Africa, before finally settling for a job as a flight attendant. Savanna Todd as a baby with her mother Dorothy before Ms Barnett fled overseas and began living life under the radar until her arrest in Townsville last year . Loving relationship: Barnett and 11-month-old Savanna disappeared and embarked on their lives as fugitives, travelling to Malaysia, Singapore, and South Africa where Barnett married Juan Geldenhuys and had a son . When the pair met, and married after a whirlwind romance, Dorothy became pregnant with her daughter. Dorothy Barnett's friends told the Seven Network that Benjamin Todd had wanted Barnett to terminate her pregnancy with Savanna in 1993. But when the marriage failed, it was Todd who gained custody of Savanna following a court case in which he alleged Barnett was bipolar, and she was awarded only supervised access to her baby daughter. It was on one of these visits Barnett and 11-month-old Savanna disappeared and embarked on their lives as fugitives, travelling to Malaysia, Singapore, and South Africa where Barnett married Juan Geldenhuys and they had a son. Mr Todd's lawyer, J Graham Sturgis told Channel Seven, Benjamin Todd 'never quit' looking for his daughter. 'For years he updated her room to be age appropriate and would record a video message to her on her birthdays,' Mr Sturgis said . Nervous: Benjamind Todd II (left on television during the years he searched for his daughter) and (right) last year after learning his 20 year wait had come to an end, but at a time when he was still unsure whether Savanna/Samantha would want to meet him . The couple emigrated to New Zealand, where they gained citizenship, and then Barnett and her children moved to Australia's Sunshine Coast, where they were known as Alexandria, Samantha and Rhys Geldenhuys. It was over evening drinks after a day's sailing in 2011 that 'Alex Geldenhuys' slipped up. Ms Barnett referred to Samantha as 'Savanna' and said she had fled an 'abusive' relationship in America. Barnett's South African friends went online and found a page on the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children's website. They saw pictures of a woman who looked like a younger 'Alex' and an age-advanced photo of a girl who resembled Samantha. They contacted Benjamin Todd III  in America. His long hunt for Savanna was over. Tearful reunion: Samantha speaks on a phone to her mother inside the South Carolina prison where Dorothy Barnett is serving time for her kidnap and passport fraud offences . Dorothy Barnett cries as she speaks with her daughter in the prison where she is serving 21 months after being deported and pleading guilty to kidnapping her own child from the US in 1994 . As Mr Todd's lawyer, J Graham Sturgis told Channel Seven, Benjamin Todd 'never quit' looking for his daughter. 'For years he updated her room to be age appropriate and would record a video message to her on her birthdays,' Mr Sturgis said. 'It is a parent's worst nightmare not to know what happened to a child [but] he never lost hope and pursued every possibility that might lead to her recovery.' However, friends of Ms Barnett described Todd as an 'evil, evil man' while Barnett herself described his pursuit of her as 'corrupt' and 'criminal'. Whatever is the truth, the extraordinary story of how Ms Barnett eluded the FBI for two decades, and how her life as a lie unravelled, is said to have 'deeply confused' 21-year-old Samantha. Channel Seven filmed her as she reunited with Ms Barnett in the South Carolina prison where she is serving a 21 month sentence after pleading guilty to one count of International Parental Kidnapping and two counts of False Statement in a Passport Application. Ms Barnett will be required to undergo two years’ supervised parole following her release. While Channel Seven has not yet revealed whether Samantha finally meets her real father, there has been emotions running high on both sides. 'His daughter thus far has been reluctant to meet,' J Graham Sturgis, told Daily Mail Australia. 'She only knows her mother and the misinformation that has been provided her. She likely would be considered by her mother to be disloyal if she were to meet [Todd] at this time.' Mr Sturgis said the intensely private stockbroker understood why the daughter snatched from him and who never knew him as father had  held off from speaking with him, and that he feared jeopardising his hoped-for reunion with her. But Mr Sturgis said Todd yearned for the 'long awaited opportunity' of meeting Savanna and had literally counted the days - 19 years, six months and 12 days - from the access visit on which Savanna disappeared  to when Australian police knocked on a door in faraway Townsville and his long lost daughter was found.

{"raw_input": "Remembered in history by some as a murderous tyrant, few people may want to be related to Richard III. But the historian who confirmed the identity of the old king’s remains when they were discovered in a Leicester car park has found a direct link between the former Plantagenet monarch and English actor Benedict Cumberbatch. Professor Kevin Schürer said that the pair are second cousins, 16 times removed. Scroll down for video . Actor Benedict Cumberbatch (shown) is as closely related to Richard III as the Queen, a genealogist has claimed. Professor Kevin Schürer - the historian who confirmed the identity of the old king’s remains when they were discovered in a Leicester car park - said that the pair are second cousins, 16 times removed . The actor will play Richard III in a forth-coming television programme and it's not the first time the actor's ancestry has revealed surprising parallels with his roles, as genealogists claimed he was related to codebreaker Alan Turing, who he played in 'The Imitation Game'. It has been estimated that between one million and 17 million people in the UK are related in some way related to the former Plantagenet monarch, although not as closely as Cumberbatch. Professor Schürer said: ‘Benedict is Richard III’s second cousin, 16 removed. ‘He is linked in several ways, but in terms of number of generations, the shortest is via Richard’s mother, Cecily Neville’s grandmother Joan Beaufort. A family tree showing how the actor and former Plantagenet monarch are related is pictured. Professor Schürer first announced a link between the actor and the late king earlier this year, but at the time said that they were third cousins. He has since revised this . It has been estimated that between one million and 17 million people in the UK are in some way related to Richard III (illustrated left), although not as closely as Mr Cumberbatch (pictured right) Tomorrow, Richard III's coffin, containing his mortal remains, will be lowered into a specially made tomb of Swaledale stone in Leicester Cathedral. The historic moment will be witnessed by the Countess of Wessex, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, presiding. Benedict Cumberbatch will read a poem called 'Richard' written by Carol Ann Duffy. It is reported the Queen has written a tribute in the order of service acknowledging Richard’s role in British history. Last Sunday, thousands of people watched a procession of the king's coffin through Leicester city centre. ‘He also has more indirect links to both Queen Elizabeth II and Lady Jane Grey through other ancestors in his tree.’ Professor Schürer first announced a link between the actor and the late king earlier this year, but at the time said that they were third cousins. He has since revised this. Oscar-nominated Cumberbatch will take part in Thursday’s service of reinterment of King Richard III at Leicester Cathedral. He will read a specially commissioned poem entitled ‘Richard’, by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy. The 38-year-old Sherlock actor will additionally star as the English king in BBC's The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses, an adaptation of four of Shakespeare's historical plays. Cumberbatch family genealogist, Bob Cumberbatch, said: 'Personally, I think it's fabulous. 'My colleague Andrew Millard estimates that there is a probability greater than 99 per cent that a modern English person is descended from Edward III.' However, he added that finding documentary evidence of this connection is a completely different matter. The 38-year-old Sherlock actor will star as the English king in BBC's The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses, an adaptation of four of Shakespeare's historical plays, a shot is shown . 'Miriam Silverman, of Ancestry UK, discovered a connection between Cumberbatch and Alan Turing and now the Leicester team have extended this to reveal a connection to Richard III. 'If Andrew Millard's conclusions are right then it seems highly probable that Benedict may indeed be related to many characters he has played and will play in future with some exceptions such as Sherlock.' Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 - ending the Wars of the Roses and the Plantagenet dynasty. His body was taken to Leicester by supporters of the victorious Henry VII and buried in Greyfriars church. In February 2013 a skeleton discovered beneath a Leicester car park was confirmed as that of the English king. Mr Cumberbatch is believed to be as closely related to Richard III (right) as the Queen, Professor Schürer said . On Sunday, 35,000 people lined the route of a procession high in symbolism through the Leicestershire countryside taking Richard back to near the spot where he fell at Bosworth field, where prayers were said for all the dead of that battle. Later, he was carried through the city centre on a horse-drawn gun carriage before being borne inside the cathedral where he was welcomed as 'our brother, Richard' by Bishop of Leicester, the Rt Rev Tim Stevens. The cathedral has said the week of ceremony offers the king the 'dignity and honour' he was denied immediately after his death. Members of the public are able to view the monarch's coffin (pictured) until his reburial tomorrow, at a mass which will be led by Justin Welby . In 2012, the University of Leicester in collaboration with the Richard III Society and Leicester City Council, began searching for the king's body. The excavation uncovered not only the friary of Grey Friars but also a battle-scarred skeleton (shown) with spinal curvature. It was unveiled as King Richard III in February 2013 . A crown sits on top of Richard III's coffin, as he lies in repose at the cathedral until his formal reburial . Tomorrow, Richard III's coffin, containing his mortal remains, will be lowered into a specially made tomb of Swaledale stone in Leicester Cathedral. It is reported that the Queen has written a tribute in the order of service acknowledging Richard’s role in British history. The historic moment will be witnessed by the Countess of Wessex, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, presiding. The Bishop of Leicester said tomorrow’s service would be 'solemn, but hopeful' and mark the 'extraordinary moment' in English history that Richard’s death on August 22 1485 represented. 'It is a major national and international occasion with a lot of ceremony,' he said. 'The peers from Bosworth families, descendants of those who fought on both sides of the battle, will be here.' 'The coffin will be borne into the sanctuary of the cathedral where it will be committed to the ground, into the vault which has been prepared.' A piece of music has been written for the occasion by the Master of the Queen’s Music Judith Weir, while Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy penned the 14-line poem entitled Richard to be read by Cumberbatch. Tomorrow, Richard III's coffin, containing his mortal remains, will be lowered into a specially made tomb of Swaledale stone in Leicester Cathedral. Thousands of people watched the procession of the former king's coffin (pictured), through the city centre, on Sunday . The spot (circled in red) where archaeologists found the remains of the 15th century monarch . The poem is described as a meditation on the impact of the discovery of Richard’s remains under a council car park in 2012, and the legacy of his story. It includes the line, 'grant me the carving of my name', in reference to carvings on his tomb which read Richard III, together with his symbol, the white boar. Ms Duffy said: 'It is a privilege to be involved, in a small way, in this unique event.' Professor Schurer, who played a key role in identifying Richard's modern day relations, published a paper  showing there was a 99.999 per cent probability that the remains were those of the king. Cumberbatch also shares a common 15th century ancestor, John Beaufort, the Earl of Somerset, with Second World War codebreaker Alan Turing, making them 17th cousins. Mr Turing helped alter the course of the war after he created a machine that allowed the Allies to read secret German messages. The star, who won plaudits for playing a slave owner in 12 Years A Slave last year, is also descended from a long line of slave owners in Barbados. Earlier this year, a New York City commissioner Stacey Cumberbatch, claimed she gained her distinctive surname because her ancestors were owned by the star's fifth great-grandfather on a sugar plantation. Mr Cumberbatch once said his part in another anti-slavery film – Amazing Grace – was a sort of apology' for his ancestry. He also revealed that his mother, the actress Wanda Ventham, once urged him not to use his real surname professionally in case it made him a target for reparation claims by the descendants of slaves. A plastic facial model made from the skull of England's King Richard III . Richard was born on in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. During the War of the Roses, Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne. Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king. In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Edward V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate. Richard III took to the throne the following day. He was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes disappeared, Rumours claimed the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign. In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire. Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII. It has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, although rumours of a withered arm haven't been verfied form the bones found in the Leicester car park last year. Last year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after finding large numbers of the parasite's eggs in soil taken from Richard III's pelvic region. The find suggests that the king's intestines were infected with roundworm during his life.", "raw_output": "Mr Cumberbatch and Richard III are second cousins, 16 times removed .\nActor is as closely related to former king as the Queen, it has been claimed .\nKevin Schurer of the University of Leicester traced the line of descent .\nProfessor Schürer first announced the link earlier this year .\nBut at the time he said they were third cousins and this has been revised .\nBenedict Cumberbatch will read a poem at Richard III's burial tomorrow .\nSherlock star will play the infamous king in BBC series The Hollow Crown .", "trunc_input": "Remembered in history by some as a murderous tyrant, few people may want to be related to Richard III.

Mr Cumberbatch once said his part in another anti-slavery film – Amazing Grace – was a sort of apology' for his ancestry. He also revealed that his mother, the actress Wanda Ventham, once urged him not to use his real surname professionally in case it made him a target for reparation claims by the descendants of slaves. A plastic facial model made from the skull of England's King Richard III . Richard was born on in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. During the War of the Roses, Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne. Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king. In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Edward V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate. Richard III took to the throne the following day. He was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes disappeared, Rumours claimed the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign. In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire. Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII. It has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, although rumours of a withered arm haven't been verfied form the bones found in the Leicester car park last year. Last year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after finding large numbers of the parasite's eggs in soil taken from Richard III's pelvic region. The find suggests that the king's intestines were infected with roundworm during his life.", "trunc_output": "Mr Cumberbatch and Richard III are second cousins, 16 times removed .\nActor is as closely

{"raw_input": "A watchdog has cleared officers over the case of a four-year-old boy starved to death by his alcoholic mother, despite years of police contact with the family. Hamzah Khan's decomposed body was found in a cot at his filthy home in Bradford in 2011, almost two years after he had died. The family, including his mother Amanda Hutton, 43, had extensive contact with police over a number of years, but today the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found that Hamzah's death was not something West Yorkshire Police 'could have reasonably been expected to predict or prevent', the police watchdog has found. A watchdog has cleared West Yorkshire Police over the case of four-year-old Hamzah Khan (pictured), who was starved to death by his alcoholic mother despite years of police contact with the family . Mother-of-eight Hutton was jailed for 15 years in 2013 after she was found guilty of Hamzah's manslaughter and neglecting five of her other children. At her trial it emerged that a range of agencies, including police officers, had contact with her family because she was a victim of repeated domestic violence, but no one spotted the danger the children were in. The IPCC had launched an investigation into West Yorkshire Police’s handling of concerns raised about Hamzah’s welfare, the results of which were announced today. In a statement, the watchdog said: 'The IPCC investigation concluded that Hamzah's death was not something West Yorkshire Police could have reasonably been expected to predict or prevent, and that it was the actions of a PCSO who made repeated and concerted attempts to speak to Ms Hutton that led to the discovery of Hamzah's body.' Mother-of-eight Amanda Hutton (pictured) was jailed for 15 years in 2013 after she was found guilty of Hamzah's manslaughter and neglecting five of her other children . The commission said there had been no misconduct by officers but did criticise the force for not referring itself to the IPCC at the time the body was discovered. It said the fact it was not referred 'hindered the IPCC in its obligation to carry out a prompt and effective independent investigation into West Yorkshire Police's contact with the family'. IPCC commissioner Cindy Butts said: 'There was a clear public interest in enabling the Independent Police Complaints Commission to scrutinise the actions of West Yorkshire Police officers after the discovery of Hamzah's body in 2011. 'The fact that this was not reported to the IPCC until after a serious case review had been completed in 2013 meant that that process was completed without any independent scrutiny of police action.' Hutton's trial heard how Hamzah's father, Aftab Khan, raised concerns with officers after he was arrested for attacking Hutton but detectives told the court these were investigated and no problems were found. Today, the IPCC said two officers chose not to make a referral to social services after specific allegations of neglect were made during this interview in December 2008. But it said in its statement: 'The IPCC found that a number of referrals had already been made, one of which was made only five days before the interview with Mr Khan. A further referral to social services could have been made but there was no requirement for the officers to do so.' A serious case review in Hamzah's case concluded that he was 'invisible for almost a lifetime'. But that review was criticised at its publication by children's minister Edward Timpson, who expressed 'deep concerns', saying it failed to fully explain 'missed opportunities to protect children in the house'. The minister wrote to Professor Nick Frost, who chairs the Bradford Safeguarding Children Board, saying: 'I have deep concerns over the Hamzah Khan serious case review. The child's body was found in what police said were 'breathtakingly awful' conditions in a bedroom at Hutton's house in Bradford, while the kitchen was also filled with rubbish . The living room of Hutton's home was covered in old takeaway boxes, bottles and plastic bags . 'In particular, I am concerned that it fails to explain sufficiently clearly the actions taken or not taken by children's social care when problems in the Khan family were brought to their attention on a number of occasions.' Alcoholic Hutton was living in what the report described as 'breathtakingly awful' conditions with five of her children as well as Hamzah's mummified remains when police entered her four-bedroom house in September 2011. A jury at Bradford Crown Court found she had allowed Hamzah to starve to death in December 2009 and left his body in a cot with a teddy. The remains were only discovered due to a rookie police community support officer's tenacious pursuit of a minor anti-social behaviour complaint because she knew something was wrong. The family was known to all the main agencies, partly due to a long history of violence Hutton suffered at the hands of Khan. But Hutton failed to co-operate with many children's services and the SCR found that Hamzah slipped below the radar and was invisible. Ms Butts said today: 'Nothing could have reasonably been done by West Yorkshire Police to predict or prevent this horrendous case of child neglect. In fact, it was the tenacity of one of its officers that led to the eventual discovery of his body.'", "raw_output": "Hamzah Khan's decomposed body found in cot two years after his death .\nAmanda Hutton, 43, jailed for 15 years for manslaughter and neglect .\nPolice had contact with family as mother was domestic violence victim .\nFather's neglect concerns from 2008 were not referred to social services .\nIPCC finds Hamzah's death was not something police 'could have reasonably been expected to predict or prevent'", "trunc_input": "A watchdog has cleared officers over the case of a four-year-old boy starved to death by his alcoholic mother, despite years of police contact with the family.

{"raw_input": "(CNN)The Rev. Fred Craddock, the pulpit giant who was \"like no other preacher you have ever heard,\" has died, his church announced. Craddock, who redefined the art of preaching, died Friday in Blue Ridge, Georgia. The cause has not been disclosed. The 86-year-old had been in declining health due to Parkinson's disease in recent years, according to the United Methodist Reporter. \"Fred Craddock was a national treasure and a devoted servant of the church and Jesus Christ. His impact on preaching -- in terms both of scholarship and practice -- is incalculable,\" said the Rev. Thomas Long, a friend and a pastor at Emory University's Candler School of Theology. Craddock faces his toughest convert . Preachers studied classic Craddock sermons such as \"Have You Heard John Preach?\" and \"Grace and Disgrace,\" much like aspiring jazz musicians listened to saxophonist John Coltrane and amateur boxers studied tapes of Sugar Ray Robinson -- for clues to greatness and inspiration. Craddock elevated preaching to an art. He was often called a preaching genius. Rather than deliver a sermon like a lecture -- an intro, three main points and a conclusion -- he developed an \"inductive\" conversational style of preaching. His sermons unfolded like a short story -- there was foreshadowing, plot twists, dialogue; language of startling beauty and surprise endings. The way he ended his sermons was as memorable as what he said. He would abruptly stop, turn from the pulpit, and quietly sit as the audience sat in silence. People didn't applaud or shout hallelujah after his sermons. They were too busy absorbing what he had just said. The Rev. Barbara Brown Taylor, an author and world-renowned preacher, once said of Craddock: \"He spoke of Kierkegaard as easily as he spoke of the Indianapolis 500. He quoted Kafka as helpfully as Corinthians... but he was also someone who noticed a lot about ordinary human life on earth.\" Craddock, who taught preaching at  the Candler School of Theology until his retirement, was selected as one of the 12 most effective preachers in the English-speaking world in a poll of 341 seminary professors and editors of religious periodicals in 1996. I had a chance to meet Craddock, as well as hear him. I spent several weeks with him in the autumn of 2011 to write a profile about his relationship with his father. He was just as impressive outside the pulpit. He would ease his rotund little body in a wooden chair and share touching stories about growing up poor in the small town of Humboldt, Tennessee, during the Depression with an alcoholic father. He'd talk about the infirmities of old age -- I remember saying with a chuckle that \"I should have something\" when referring to his bout with Parkinson's because he was getting old. He was funny, folksy, witty and his eyes danced with glee when he told a story. Sitting in Craddock's presence was like listening to a wise uncle or grandmother. He had courtly, Southern manners, and he gave the impression that he had all the time in the world for you. I never once heard him criticize anyone. It's not uncommon to meet great people who, to borrow a phrase that Craddock used, have \"domestic wreckage\" at home. But the Craddock family was among his biggest fans. He was married to his high school sweetheart, Nettie, for more than 50 years, and they had two children, Laura and John. Laura named her son after her father. And John, who became a CEO instead of a pastor, said his father was the most remarkable man he knew. \"I don't care if it's a guy on the street asking for a dollar or the president of the United States, he makes you feel as if you're the most important person in the world when he's talking to you,\" said John Craddock. \"I won the lottery as far as great fathers go.\" Over the years, I kept in contact with him. I'd go to preaching workshops at his beloved Craddock Center, a non-profit ministry that served needy children in North Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina. The center provides books, hot meals, storytelling and music. Perhaps Craddock saw something of himself in the kids he helped. One thing is certain: He wasn't content to preach compassion. He lived that message. Craddock's funeral will be held at 2 p.m. Monday at Cherry Log Christian Church in Blue Ridge, Georgia.

Killick, who was handed a lengthy ban after admitting a Football Association charge relating to his conduct, ensured he watched Poole's 3-2 win on Saturday by peering out of the window of a house belonging to the club's groundsman. Luckily for the Evo-Stik Southern boss, Poole's groundsman lives just yards away from the club's home ground. Poole Town boss Tom Killick watches his side's match against Cambridge City from a skylight window . Killick decided to watch the match from groundman Chris Kelly's house due to his six-match stadium ban . The Poole Town boss pokes his head out of the groundsman's window as his players take on Cambridge . Poole's groundsman lives just yards away from the club's home ground - his house is circled above . The Poole boss, speaking to the Bournemouth Echo, said of his view: 'I can pretty much see the whole pitch apart from the goalmouth at the end I watch it from. It is quite a good vantage point but being detached from the players makes life difficult. 'I did not realise the significance of it at first, it just did not sink in. It is only the passage of time and games that makes you fully understand what it involves and just how much you miss. 'Thankfully, James (Wood, assistant manager), Robbie (Yates, goalkeeper coach) and the players have been relatively unaffected by it so they deserve all the credit. The personal difficulty for me is secondary.' Killick, who was given a six-match stadium ban for remonstrating with referee Ben Knight following Dolphins' 1-0 defeat by Redditch on January 17, has just one game left to serve of his punishment. He will be hoping for a similar vantage point on Tuesday when Poole take on Corby Town in the second leg of the Southern League Cup final.

Killick, who was handed a lengthy ban after admitting a Football Association charge relating to his conduct, ensured he watched Poole's 3-2 win on Saturday by peering out of the window of a house belonging to the club's groundsman. Luckily for the Evo-Stik Southern boss, Poole's groundsman lives just yards away from the club's home ground. Poole Town boss Tom Killick watches his side's match against Cambridge City from a skylight window . Killick decided to watch the match from groundman Chris Kelly's house due to his six-match stadium ban . The Poole Town boss pokes his head out of the groundsman's window as his players take on Cambridge . Poole's groundsman lives just yards away from the club's home ground - his house is circled above . The Poole boss, speaking to the Bournemouth Echo, said of his view: 'I can pretty much see the whole pitch apart from the goalmouth at the end I watch it from. It is quite a good vantage point but being detached from the players makes life difficult. 'I did not realise the significance of it at first, it just did not sink in. It is only the passage of time and games that makes you fully understand what it involves and just how much you miss. 'Thankfully, James (Wood, assistant manager), Robbie (Yates, goalkeeper coach) and the players have been relatively unaffected by it so they deserve all the credit. The personal difficulty for me is secondary.' Killick, who was given a six-match stadium ban for remonstrating with referee Ben Knight following Dolphins' 1-0 defeat by Redditch on January 17, has just one game left to serve of his punishment. He will be hoping for a similar vantage point on Tuesday when Poole take on Corby Town in the second leg of the Southern League Cup final.

{"raw_input": "Game show viewers were left outraged by a buzzer's failure to ring out on Wednesday night's Family Feud, which saw a family miss out on winning a brand-new car. Team captains Matt Molloy and Mary Ryan were facing off at sudden death when the controversial moment happened. If the Ryans won they would have become the brand-new champions of the show, while the Molloys would have walked away with a Mitsubishi Outlander four-wheel-drive. Viewers were outraged when the Molloy family were beaten out by the Ryan family on Family Feud when a buzzer appeared to malfunction . Host Grant Denyer asked the pair to 'name something you might eat with egg'. In footage of the show, Mr Molloy is seen pushing down on the buzzer first to answer but no sound comes from it. A split second later, Ms Ryan reacts but her buzzer rings out much to the surprise of herself, Denyer, her opponent and the audience - who let out a big collective groan. The female contestant had to check the light below her button had been illuminated before she ventured to answer. Mary Ryan (left) and Matt Molloy (right) faced off at sudden death on Wednesday night . Denyer pauses for a few moments but in the end he allows Ms Ryan to answer the question with 'bacon', winning her family their title.

Top celebrities such as Sir Tom Jones, Jonathan Ross, Jack Wilshere, Vivienne Westwood, Katie Price and over 50 more famous faces have donated their shoes to be auctioned off on the British Heart Foundation’s (BHF) eBay site as part of Good Morning Britain’s Heels 4 Hearts campaign. Shoes that have been donated include a pair of cowboy boots worn by Alison Steadman for an episode of Gavin & Stacey, stilettos worn by TV personality and epic strutter Michael Van Schoick and the wedding shoes Gemma Atkinson wore in her first scene in Emmerdale. Good Morning Britain’s Heels 4 Hearts campaign, supported by the BHF, will give every secondary school pupil in the UK the possibility to learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Glamour model Katie Price supported the #Heels4Hearts campaign by donating a pair of white stilettos . Funds raised through the campaign will aim to provide every secondary school in the UK with a CPR kit so that young people can learn the life saving skill. Good Morning Britain is appealing to the public to donate their unwanted shoes to BHF shops during the campaign (23rd to 28th March) which will then go towards funding the CPR kits. In the UK, less than one in ten people survive an out of hospital cardiac arrest. Veteran singer and judge on The Voice Sir Tom Jones handed over a pair of black monk shoes to support the fundraising campaign, whilst TV presenter Jonathan Ross donated some black leather shoes . Yet in some parts of Norway, where CPR training is taught in secondary school, survival rates are one in four. If the UK achieved the same rates as Norway, we could save the lives of up to 5,000 people every year. Diane Locke, BHF Deputy Retail Director, said: 'We’re delighted that so many celebrities have donated to Good Morning Britain’s Heels 4 Hearts campaign and are very grateful for every pair. 'We’re very lucky to have been donated all types of shoes, from designer brands and high heels to sport shoes from over 50 celebrities. Arsenal player Jack Wilshere donated a signed pair of football boots in support of the British Heart Foundation's campaign . 'There really is something for everyone available, so please visit bhf.org.uk and take a look. The profit raised from each pair of shoes will help give us the chance for every secondary school pupil in the UK to learn CPR.' Last financial year, BHF stores raised over £31 million to help the BHF fight heart disease, the nation’s single biggest killer.

{"raw_input": "New research funded by farmers aims to breed a wheat variety for people who can't eat the  grain, an endeavor that comes as wider consumer interest in gluten-free foods is booming. The Kansas Wheat Commission is spending $200,000 for the first two years of the project, which is meant to identify everything in wheat's DNA sequences that can trigger a reaction in people suffering from celiac disease. The disease is an autoimmune disorder in which eating even tiny amounts of gluten - made up of numerous, complex proteins that gives dough its elasticity and some flavor to baked goods - can damage the small intestine. Chris Miller, senior director of research for Engrain, a Kansas company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry, said funding research to breed gluten-free wheat is 'the right thing to do' The only known treatment known is a gluten-free diet, which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat, rye and barley. Though celiac disease is four-to-five times more common now than 50 years ago, only about one per cent of the world's population is believed to suffer from it, and just a fraction have been diagnosed. But the gluten-free food business has skyrocketed in the last five years, driven in part by non-celiac sufferers who are either intolerant to gluten or following a gluten-free fad diet because they believe it may help them lose weight or that it's somehow healthier. Sales of gluten-free snacks, crackers, pasta, bread and other products reached $973million in the United States in 2014, up from $810million the previous year, according to a January report by consumer research firm Packaged Facts. The research analyzed the sales of hundreds of explicitly labeled and marketed gluten-free products and brands at supermarkets, drugstores, and mass merchandisers. Supporters of the Kansas research, though, say this isn't a way to regain market share. Miller shows a flour solution from a specific strain of wheat at a research facility in the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas. The only known treatment for celiac desiseas is a gluten-free diet, which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat, rye and barley . The research for gluten-free wheat began in July at the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas. It is still in its early stages and researchers are looking at proteins inside the grain . 'If you know you are producing a crop that is not tolerated well by people, then it's the right thing to do,' according to the project's lead researcher, Chris Miller, senior director of research for Engrain, a Kansas company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry. Gluten-free foods are a niche product, and in the broader context of the world's wheat markets, it is not a driving factor, according to Dan O'Brien, extension grain market specialist at Kansas State University. 'I anticipate it will develop as a specialty market,' Miller said.The research, which began in July at the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas, is still in its early stages, with researchers extracting proteins from seeds of various varieties of wheat. Miller has yet to begin work combining the proteins with antibodies produced by the human immune system to test for reactions. He also plans to examine the wild relatives of wheat as well as modern varieties, and will tap into a Kansas wheat variety repository that dates back to the 1900s in hopes of finding a variety - perhaps one that fell out of favor among commercial farmers - that might already be low in reactivity for celiac sufferers. Researchers hope to use that variety to develop a gluten-free wheat using traditional breeding methods. Miller's methodology might be 'too simplistic an approach' that wouldn't identify all the toxic sequences that trigger a celiac reaction, according to Armin Alaedini, assistant professor of medical sciences at Columbia University and a researcher at the New York-based school's Celiac Disease Center. Miller (pictured) plans to look at wild relatives of wheat as well as modern grains. Researchers hope to use these varieties and traditional breeding methods to develop a gluten-free wheat . Alaedini, after looking at Miller's plan online, said the project may end up with a less toxic wheat product that isn't completely safe for all celiac disease patients. 'After all this effort, this product that is coming out... is unlikely to be superior in terms of nutritional value or baking properties and taste to the gluten-free products that are already on the market,' Alaedini said. The medical advisory board for the Celiac Disease Foundation, a nonprofit based in Woodland Hills, California, could not reach a consensus on the viability of Miller's research. But the organization's CEO, Marilyn Geller, is encouraged. Her son had been sick his entire life before being diagnosed with celiac disease at age 15, Geller said, and his father also was later diagnosed. Since the disorder is genetic, her grandchildren will be at risk of getting it. The more the disease is in the public eye, the more physicians are aware of it, she said, and it'll be more likely the federal government would fund research. 'I am certain that there are a large number of people with celiac disease who (like) the idea of being able to eat actual wheat, with the properties of wheat that make the bread nice and fluffy,' she said. 'The idea of having a variety of wheat that they could eat that has those wonderful wheat-like properties would certainly be very interesting for them.'

{"raw_input": "A University of Southern California chief has vowed to carry out his own investigation into claims  the son of Empire star Taraji P. Henson was 'racially profiled' on campus. The school's Public Safety director, John Thomas, said he was 'disturbed' by reports the actress's son Marcel had been stopped by police on campus for having his hands in his pockets. It comes after Henson revealed she had now decided to send the 20-year-old to historically black Howard University. Scroll down for video . Taraji P. Henson says her son Marcel was racially profiled by police at University of Southern California. The mother and son are pictured above at a film screening in Hollywood last April . Empire star Henson, 44, says her son was stopped at University of California (file picture) for having his hands in his pockets . In an interview with Uptown magazine, she said her son was racially profiled elsewhere in California beforehand and did 'exactly everything the cops told him to do, including letting them illegally search his car. 'It was bogus because they didn’t give him the ticket for what he was pulled over for,' she said. 'Then he’s at University of Southern California, the school that I was going to transfer him to, when police stopped him for having his hands in his pockets.' After learning of the USC allegation, John Thomas revealed that he too had experienced racial profiling as a teenager . In a statement, he said: 'I was deeply disturbed to read news reports about a prospective student who felt profiled on or near campus because of his race. 'We encourage reporting of allegations of bias and I hope for the opportunity to have a conversation with the young man and his mother. Henson has revealed she has now decided to send her 20-year-old son Marcel to historically-black college . 'I would like to look into this matter further and better understand who was involved and what took place. 'As someone who personally experienced racial profiling as a teenager, I have a stake in learning more about this incident and doing all I can to reach a just resolution.' He said he was not yet clear on which police departments were involved and that 'any allegation of bias or unequal treatment by university officers would trigger an investigation that I would supervise along with the university's Office of Equity and Diversity'. He continued: 'It is my expectation and that of the university that our department uphold the highest standards of constitutional policing, affording equal rights and respect to all persons.' Marcel is Henson's only child, and his father was her high school sweetheart. New hit: Henson currently stars on Fox drama Empire as Cookie Lyon, the recently-released-from-prison ex-wife of a music mogul (played by Terrence Howard) After revealing her son's ordeal, the 44-year-old said in the interview: 'So guess where he’s going? Howard University. I’m not paying $50K so I can’t sleep at night wondering is this the night my son is getting racially profiled on campus. Also in the interview, Henson spoke about how happy she was to be one of now many black women leads on the small screen in shows like Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder. 'It feels good that there’s not just one black person. I don’t like that we get fixated on one or two at a time, or three at a time. If you look at Caucasian Hollywood, every year there’s a handful of new faces you’ve never seen before, then after that, they got five movies coming out and they’re introducing you to more talent. So I’m just so happy to see what’s happening on television right now. We have options and that’s how it should be,' Henson said. Proud mother: Henson and her son pictured on January 20, 2013 - attending a celebration for leading women in Washington, DC . Empire aired it's two-hour first-season finale last week, and has already been green-lighted for a second season.

In total, just £61,000 in 59 bank accounts belonging to suspected terrorists has been blocked by the Treasury, a report has found. The report, by the independent reviewer of terror legislation David Anderson QC, showed another 28 people have had their bank accounts in the country frozen under European orders. Scroll down for video . Only 25 terror suspects are currently subject to asset-freezing orders, a report by independent reviewer into terror legislation David Anderson QC (pictured), revealed . It showed there were eight new Treasury designations in the year to September 2014 under the Terrorist Asset-Freezing Act 2010 - a sharp decline from 162 in 2008. Mr Anderson concluded the figures for assets frozen were 'remarkably low. He said they indicate asset-freezing has played only a 'marginal role' in combating 'the most serious terrorist threat of the present time'. Sharmeena Begum was revealed as the 15-year-old British schoolgirl who led three others to join ISIS . 'Travel to and from such conflict zones, together with the preparation of terrorist acts, often requires funding and facilitation,' he said. 'There has been an attempt to use asset-freezing legislation to respond to the threat posed by UK residents who travel to and from Syria and Iraq for the purposes of terrorism. 'But bearing in mind that over 600 Britons have travelled out there, the small number of designations indicates that asset-freezing has played only a marginal role in combating the most serious terrorist threat of the present time.' The report will raise serious concerns as increasingly numbers of young homegrown jihadists continue to abandon their homes in favour of Islamic State. It comes as the identity of a 15-year-old London schoolgirl who led her three best friends to Syria after becoming radicalised was revealed. Sharmeena Begum fled Britain to join Islamic State in December - and was the first of four GCSE pupils at the same school to become jihadi brides. She is believed to be in the IS stronghold of Raqqa with Bethnal Green Academy pupils Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, who travelled to Syria last month. Yesterday, video emerged apparently showing the three runaway British schoolgirls in Turkey before they fled into Syria to become brides for Islamic State militants. The footage is believed to have been taken by a foreign spy who was arrested for helping the trio cross the border. The girls are said to have first arrived at Istanbul Ataturk Airport before heading to the southern city of Gaziantep close to the Syrian border. New footage emerged that claims to show three British schoolgirls in Turkey before they fled across the border in Syria to become jihadi brides for ISIS militants . The footage is believed to have been taken by a foreign spy working for the Canadian intelligence service who was arrested on Thursday for helping the trio cross the border . Earlier this week, it emerged the girls had paid for their flights out of the UK after stealing jewellery from their family. Police discovered they paid the £1,000 cost of their flights from Gatwick airport to Istanbul in cash. But their families, appearing before the House of Commons home affairs committee, insisted that someone else helped them with the cost of the air tickets as the missing jewellery was not worth £1,000. Halima Khanom, sister of Kadiza Sultana, said: ‘My sister used to borrow a piece of jewellery off my daughters that was very sentimental to her and that’s what she’s taken.

{"raw_input": "(CNN)It looks like the Republicans in Congress have failed again. House Republicans defeated a plan pushed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to fund the Department of Homeland Security, money that congressional Republicans have been holding hostage in their effort to overturn President Obama's executive order on immigration. McConnell proposed that there would be a separate vote on the immigration issue. When Speaker John Boehner proposed an even narrower compromise, funding the Department for only three more weeks, his caucus said no. The final bill provides funding for one more week, at which point Congress needs to take up the issue again. Yet from a different perspective, congressional Republicans are achieving their goal. Once again they are using up a valuable chunk of President Obama's political time. Congress has already squandered several months rather than addressing bigger questions, such as economic inequality or climate change, which the White House hoped to put at the center of political debate even if the Republicans refused to do anything about these problems. While the odds of the president making progress on key issues is extremely slim, President Obama has not even had a chance to introduce issues fully into public debate -- a key function of presidents who hope to build the groundwork for future legislative breakthroughs and shape the national conversation -- or to even to attempt to make progress on issues, like tax reform, where there is potential support for a bipartisan breakthrough. Using up the legislative clock has been central to the Republican strategy since the 2010 midterm elections, a tactic that the Democrats have found difficult to fight back against. The strategy has been pretty straightforward. Each time that President Obama tried to introduce a new issue to the nation, whether that has to do with immigration reform or economic inequality, Republicans have instantly shifted public attention elsewhere by threatening extreme action on some other area of policy. This is what Republicans did in 2010 and 2011 when they warned that they would not raise the debt limit ceiling if Democrats did not accede to their budget demands. Congress spent many months wrangling over the budget as they faced the real possibility of the federal government going into default. This was all that anyone in Washington was talking about. The GOP did the same with the threat of a government shutdown. Even though the possibility of repealing the Affordable Care Act is remote, Republicans keep bringing it up for a debate, forcing Democrats to defend the program and spending more time on a proposal that nobody really thinks stands a chance of passing. The \"tea party\" faction of the House Republicans has been pivotal to this strategy as was clear this week. Since they have shown repeatedly that they are willing to employ the most extreme measures to defend their principles, and that they won't allow Boehner to rein them in for \"practical\" political considerations, Democrats can't afford to take the threats lightly. Republican leaders can and have said to the White House they would like to find reasonable solutions to these problems, but with a nod to the Republican caucus, remind Obama that they don't have full control. While it is true that these tactics have hurt the name brand of the GOP and place Republican presidential candidates at greater risk in 2016, many congressional Republicans have been willing to suffer hits in the polls because the tactic has allowed them to continue using up time on the legislative calendar. Aside from vetoing bills, President Obama doesn't have many options other than to watch the clock tick away. Now the GOP has done it again. Even if there is a resolution that continues funding for the Department of Homeland Security, months have been consumed on Capitol Hill. When the year began President Obama wanted to make economic inequality a defining theme for the year. He wanted to use the limited power he had to bring more attention to the growing divide between the rich and the poor, as well as the struggles facing middle class Americans. But he has only had limited success. Instead, he and his party have been consumed with this struggle over the budget bill. When House Republicans pushed their \"stop-gap\" measure to fund Homeland Security for just another week, they were following the standard game plan. By avoiding permanent solutions to budgeting problems, and keeping the debate over these issues in play for even more time, the GOP continues to eat away at the president's political clock. Usually political extremism does not have the virtues that Sen. Barry Goldwater claimed in his famous 1964 speech to the Republican Convention, but it sure can have short-term political benefits in Congress. Just ask Mitch McConnell, who can barely contain his grin.", "raw_output": "Julian Zelizer: GOP hogs the spotlight with funding deadlines like the battle over money for the Department of Homeland Security.\nHe says the continual crises deprive Obama of the chance to move his agenda forward even slightly .", "trunc_input": "(CNN)It looks like the Republicans in Congress have failed again.

{"raw_input": "(CNN)NASA astronaut Scott Kelly has started a trip to the record books. He plans to spend 342 days on the International Space Station -- the longest stretch of time any U.S. astronaut has spent in space. Kelly lifted off Friday aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket that launched from Kazakhstan. The rocket docked at the ISS at 9:33 p.m. ET, according to a tweet from NASA, with hatches between the Soyuz and the space station scheduled to open about 11:15 p.m. ET. Kelly will stay twice as long as any U.S. astronaut has ever stayed on the space station, giving scientists a chance to study how the human body responds to long-duration space flights. On Earth, scientists will perform parallel studies on Scott Kelly's identical twin brother, retired astronaut Mark Kelly. \"It's a lot of fun,\" Kelly said at a media briefing in January. \"Space station is a magical place.\" Two cosmonauts are riding up with Kelly: Mikhail Kornienko and Gennady Padalka. Kornienko also will stay up for a year. Padalka will only stay up for six months. The trio will join three crew members already on the space station: U.S. astronaut Terry Virts, Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov and Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. Other crew members also will rotate in and out during their year in orbit so it will never be just Kelly and Kornienko on the station. Kelly, 51, hopes to break the record for the longest mission on the space station set by NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin. They spent over seven months on the ISS -- from September 18, 2006, to April 21, 2007. He is expected to spend 342 days off the planet on this mission. When added to his previous space missions, that would give him a total of 522 days in space, breaking the record of U.S. astronaut Mike Fincke. Fincke spent a combined 381 days, 15 hours and 11 minutes in space, according to his official NASA bio. While Kelly shoots to set space station and other U.S. records, Padalka is on schedule to set a record for the most total time in space for a human. He's already spent more than 710 days in space, including stays on Russia's Mir space station and three previous stints on the International Space Station. Why do it? Why stay up on the station so long? NASA wants to know more about the impact of long-duration spaceflights on the human body to help plan missions to Mars and deeper into space. And the space station, in orbit 250 miles above Earth, is the best place available to study that. Spending that much time in a weightless environment will take a toll. NASA says space station astronauts have vision changes, bone loss, muscle atrophy and other problems. NASA says the experiments should have benefits on Earth, such as helping patients recover from long periods of bed rest to improved monitoring of people whose bodies are unable to fight infections. The space station has about the same living space as a six-bedroom, two bathroom house. And it has a 360-degree bay window with a great view. But astronauts and cosmonauts still report feeling isolated and confined at times. Kelly will document his feelings about being away from his two children and the rest of his family. \"I'm going to keep a personal journal of the experience,\" Kelly said. He also will share some of his journal with researchers studying the psychological impacts of long-term space flight. Will he tell all? \"I plan to be completely honest about it,\" he said, but ... \"who knows, maybe there are some crazy thoughts I'll have at the end that I wouldn't want to share.\" Mark Kelly has volunteered for NASA's \"Twins Study\" to see how the identical twins change over the year in two very different environments. He is the husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who left office after being wounded in a January 2011 assassination attempt. \"He thinks it's great that he can still be a participant in this,\" Scott Kelly said. So Mark will be on Earth getting poked and prodded by researchers -- while Scott makes history in orbit.

{"raw_input": "Andy Murray's hopes of playing July's Davis Cup quarter final at Queen's Club look likely to be fulfilled after positive noises emanated today from the famous west London venue. While there will undoubtedly be logistical challenges in hosting what is Great Britain's biggest home tie in 29 years there appears an enthusiasm among the club's hierarchy to overcome them. Given Murray's desire to play at a venue where he has won the Aegon Championships title three times already, there is likely to be a concerted effort to make it happen, including on the part of the Lawn Tennis Association. Andy Murray with the Aegon Championship trophy at the Queen's club in West London last month . 'We have been approached, along with some other venues, and are actively looking at whether or not we could host it,' said a Queen's spokesman. 'There are a number of logistical issues that would have to be resolved, but if it is possible to overcome them Queen's would be delighted to host the Davis Cup in July.' That date of July 17-19 comes nearly four weeks after the conclusion of the Aegon Championships, which is the main Wimbledon warm-up. Among the issues is keeping up the huge main stand which takes the centre court capacity to nearly 7,000, above the 6,000 threshold required for a quarter final. Other challenges include a scheduled refurbishment of the clubhouse due to begin in early July, and making sure the grass court – the quality of which is reckoned to be at least Wimbledon's equal – can recover in time from the summer ATP event. Murray celebrates beating USA in the Davis Cup to set up a quarter-final against France for Great Britain . The British No 1 won the pre-Wimbledon tournament at Queen's in 2013 (left), 2011 (centre) and 2009 (right) Great Britain vs France . Australia vs Kazakhstan . Argentina vs Serbia . Canada vs Belgium . It will also require considerable commitment and patience from members, with the construction of the main stand already beginning in early May and the prospect of it being up on the site of two hard courts for nearly three months. It had been thought the disruption might be too prolonged, although today's statement appears to knock that down. At the weekend Murray, due to play Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber in Indian Wells on Monday night, pointed not only to his own good record at Queen's but also the fact that his brother Jamie has made the doubles final there and James Ward the semi-finals. However, it is also a place where French players have done well, notably Jo Wilfried Tsonga, who is an enormously popular regular visitor. The Scot is in action at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, facing Philipp Kohlschreiber on Monday night . Eastbourne, Birmingham's Priory Club and Nottingham have also been approached, but Murray's opinion carries a decisive amount of weight. France were the opposition when Queen's last staged a Davis Cup tie, back in 1990. GB were beaten 5-0 then, but with Murray in his prime and France' s players by and large – bar the presently injured Tsonga – not at their best on grass, it is likely to be extremely close this time. With a three week gap between Roland Garros and Wimbledon this year, it means there will be six weeks of top-class grass court tennis played in the UK this summer.

Hanson's son, 9-year-old Billy, was visiting his father in July and was supposed to be sent back to his mother in Pennsylvania on Sept. 4, but the boy was not on the flight.

{"raw_input": "Australian teenage jihadist Jake Bilardi was expressing anti-Western sentiments years before he fled to the Middle East . Australian teenage jihadist Jake Bilardi was expressing anti-Western sentiments years before he fled to the Middle East to fight with terror group Islamic State. In comments posted about news stories and opinion pieces, Bilardi pointed out the evils of Australia and the United States. Earlier this week, Fairfax Media revealed a 'Jonathan Edwards', who was thought to be a Briton when he appeared in a photo brandishing a rifle between two bearded men in front of a black IS flag last year, was in fact an 18-year-old from Melbourne. Bilardi is a high school drop-out who attended Craigieburn Secondary College - in the Victorian capital's north. A collection of his comments seen on the website, Disqus, showed the teenager was an avid reader of Al Jazeera. They date back up to four years ago and most of them showed him weighing in on Islamic issues. In response to another commenter, Bilardi tells them to 'get a better education on the real teachings of Islam' before airing their opinion in May 2011. 'I am not a muslim [sic] but you see I am not a pathetic loser who doesn't know anything outside of their own home and I actually have a life I don't just go on the internet to abuse people and their beliefs,' the 18-year-old wrote. This came a year before the teenager, who has been dubbed the 'White Jihadist', converted to Islam and started worshipping at Melbourne mosques, according to Fairfax Media. Later in the year, Bilardi hit out at an American who he accused of Islamophobic behaviour. 'The CIA funded Al-Qaeda, the US government funded the Taliban. They brought this on themselves. You are a prime example of an Islamophobe,' Bilardi said. 'Saying \"maybe if Muslims didn't attack America\", you do realise that less than 1% of Muslims are terrorists and that Islamic terrorism only makes up 6% of global terrorism.' Bilardi added Americans were being influenced by local media, saying the same happened to Australians. 'If you're smart enough and can think for yourself you can actually realise that most of the stuff you are told are lies,' he said. Earlier this week,  a youthful Islamic State fighter posing with a rifle was identified as Melbourne teen Jake Bilardi . Jake Bilardi's aunt said the entire family was devastated by her 18-year-old nephew joining ISIS . A Craigieburn schoolmate was shocked because Bilardi 'really kept to himself and didn't cause trouble' 'America is supposed to be a land of freedom, but... the CIA can listen in on phone calls from anyone in the country, cameras have been set up on every street, people have been arrested just for being Muslim, just shows what scum are running the country.' The teenager was an avid reader of Al Jazeera and weighed in on Islamic issues in the comments section . Bilardi also accused American soldiers of 'always killing innocent civilians' in Afghanistan and Iraq, saying they were bombing and shooting them 'just for fun'. 'They are sick twisted mental patients who don't deserve to be allowed outside ever again,' he wrote. 'Then everyone gets angry when another boat full of Asylum Seekers comes into Australian waters. 'They are not only fleeing the brutality of militias and the Taliban, they are also fleeing the brutality of the Western forces.' These comment emerge as the family of Bilardi reveal they are devastated by revelations he is now fighting with the Islamic State terrorist organisation in Iraq. Speaking outside her Melbourne home, Bilardi's aunt said they were struggling with the news the skinny 18-year-old had joined the terrorist organisation and had issued threats against his homeland. She was joined by former schoolmates, who are still in shock at the teenager's transformation from awkward teenager to radical, gun-totting terrorist. ‘How are we supposed to feel? It is devastating, just devastating,’ Bilardi's aunt told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I mean, it’s my brother’s son, you are talking about.' Bilardi's aunt said the family feels like they are being harassed as a result of her nephew's radical move . Asked how the young man's father was coping with the news and his auntie's emotional response was: ‘well, he’s not’. ‘We feel like we are being harassed because of this. It’s not about me, it’s my brother’s son.' Bilardi's former schoolmates at Craigieburn Secondary College also described their shock at describing the awkward's teen conversion to terrorism. A schoolmate, who asked not to be named, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘Mate, I’m shocked at what he’s done. ‘No one at school saw this coming, we can’t believe it, he was quiet, really kept to himself and didn't cause trouble there - our parents are upset too.' In a series of tweets around Christmas time, Bilardi purportedly threatened more attacks following the Martin Place siege . In this message, Bilardi is referring to a call by an Islamic State religious leaders to commit graphic crimes against Americans, Frenchmen or their allies, including Australians . Neighbours too have been caught by surprise, with one admitting that ‘I had no idea that sort of thing could happen, not here – it’s terribly sad but I’ll keep my eyes open from now on, that’s for sure’. The 18-year-old sent a series of sick tweets to federal police gloating about future terror attacks on Australia. In one of the messages, Bilardi threatened that the Sydney Lindt café siege was ‘just the beginning for your dogs’. Bilardi described himself as a 'revert' to Islam who was 'tall, white, skinny, long hair' In August, Bilardi reported that he had arrived in the Iraqi city of Ramadi after 'making jihra' (or departing) The tweets, which were first revealed by Daily Mail Australia in December, also showed he was considering returning home to follow an Islamic State leader’s order to kill disbelievers, including Australians, by any means possible. ‘That’s twice now I’ve seriously considered coming back and following Sheikh Adnani’s fatwa in Australia,’ he wrote. In October, al-Adnani released an audio message where he implored his followers to commit graphic crimes against 'disbelieving American (sic), Frenchman or any of their allies. 'Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him,' al-Adnani said. And in another Twitter message, reportedly written this week, he said he would another attack would 'make 9/11 look like child's play.'", "raw_output": "Jake Bilardi made anti-Western comments years before he went to Iraq .\nIn comments, he pointed out the evils of Australia and the United States .\nBilardi was an avid reader of Al Jazeera and weighed in on Islamic issues .\nComments were made a year before the 18-year-old converted to Islam .\nHis family have revealed they are shock over his ties with Islamic State .", "trunc_input": "Australian teenage jihadist Jake Bilardi was expressing anti-Western sentiments years before he fled to the Middle East . Australian teenage jihadist Jake Bilardi was expressing anti-Western sentiments years before he fled to the Middle East to fight with terror group Islamic State. In comments posted about news stories and opinion pieces, Bilardi pointed out the evils of Australia and the United States. Earlier this week, Fairfax Media revealed a 'Jonathan Edwards', who was thought to be a Briton when he appeared in a photo brandishing a rifle between two bearded men in front of a black IS flag last year, was in fact an 18-year-old from Melbourne. Bilardi is a high school drop-out who attended Craigieburn Secondary College - in the Victorian capital's north. A collection of his comments seen on the website, Disqus, showed the teenager was an avid reader of Al Jazeera. They date back up to four years ago and most of them showed him weighing in on Islamic issues. In response to another commenter, Bilardi tells them to 'get a better education on the real teachings of Islam' before airing their opinion in May 2011. 'I am not a muslim [sic] but you see I am not a pathetic loser who doesn't know anything outside of their own home and I actually have a life I don't just go on the internet to abuse people and their beliefs,' the 18-year-old wrote. This came a year before the teenager, who has been dubbed the 'White Jihadist', converted to Islam and started worshipping at Melbourne mosques, according to Fairfax Media. Later in the year, Bilardi hit out at an American who he accused of Islamophobic behaviour. 'The CIA funded Al-Qaeda, the US government funded the Taliban. They brought this on themselves. You are a prime example of an Islamophobe,' Bilardi said. 'Saying \"maybe if Muslims didn't attack America\", you do realise that less than 1% of Muslims are terrorists and that Islamic terrorism only makes up 6% of global terrorism.' Bilardi added Americans were being influenced by local media, saying the same happened to Australians. 'If you're smart enough and can think for yourself you can actually realise that most of the stuff you are told are lies,' he said.

{"raw_input": "Ten-man Roma scored a late equalizer to salvage a 1-1 draw with Juventus on Monday and keep alive their faint Serie A title hopes. Former Barcelona midfielder Seydou Keita headed in following a free-kick in the 78th minute at the Stadio Olimpico after Carlos Tevez had given Juventus the lead 14 minutes earlier with a curling free-kick. Tevez's goal came shortly after Vasilios Torosidis was shown a second yellow card for a debatable foul on Arturo Vidal, marking the fourth red for Roma in their last four Serie A meetings with Juventus. Seydou Keita rose highest at the back post to head the home side level with just over 10 minutes to play . Keita turns away in celebration after heading his side's equaliser as Gianluigi Buffon pics the ball out the net . The former Barcelona midfielder celebrates with former Arsenal striker Gervinho . The latest red card could revive the controversy that followed the teams' first meeting this season in October, which Juventus won 3-2 with the aid of glaring refereeing errors. The rematch was a physical test that saw 11 yellow cards brandished. It marked Roma's sixth consecutive draw at home and the Giallorossi's seventh stalemate in their last eight matches. 'We needed three points and nothing else,' Keita said. Juventus maintain a nine-point lead over Roma with 13 rounds remaining, while Roma moved four points ahead of third-place Napoli in the race for a direct Champions League berth. 'I'm pleased with what we did until the 70th minute,' Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said. 'In the second half we improved a lot, we took the lead, but then we stopped playing. 'The season still has a long way to go and we're going to have to win more matches, especially on the road. We took a step forward but we're still far from reaching our goal.'

Vasilis Torosidis was sent off for Roma and Tevez struck from the resulting free kick . 'Down a goal with 10 men, a reaction like that shows the squad is alive and has personality and character,' Roma coach Rudi Garcia said. 'Now we've got to focus on defending second place. 'The match was very tactical with the goals coming from set pieces.' The match started 15 minutes late to show solidarity for crisis-hit Parma, who are on the verge of financial failure and have had their last two matches postponed indefinitely. Neither side produced clear chances in a tense and physical first-half that saw no shots on goal. The closest either team came to scoring early on came when Kostas Manolas intercepted a cross from Alvaro Morata and nearly redirected it into his own net in the 22nd minute. On the half-hour mark, Keita couldn't take advantage of a close-range opportunity and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon quickly collected the danger.

Both sides came out with more aggression for the second-half and a long, angled shot from Vidal went just wide in the 50th. It wasn't until just after the hour mark, though, that the course of the match changed. That was when Torosidis was penalised for what appeared to be a light touch on Vidal. With Juve free-kick specialist Andrea Pirlo missing due to injury, Tevez stepped up, and curled the resulting free-kick over Roma's wall and inside the left post from 22 yards.

{"raw_input": "An aspiring transgender hip-hop artist who bragged of carrying out black-market 'body sculpting' on thousands of women has been convicted of murder after a botched injection killed a British dancer. Padge-Victoria Windslowe's testimony during her Philadelphia trial included claims she was 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections' and model Amber Rose was 'a walking billboard' for her work. However, the former 'Black Madam' had no medical training, using only tips she picked up from the overseas doctors who performed her sex change operation and a client of her escort service. Today, she was found guilty of third-degree murder after one of her 'patients', Claudia Aderotimi, 20, a London break-dancer and college student, died from an illegal silicone injection in her buttocks. Scroll down for video . Conviction: Padge-Victoria Windslowe (left), who bragged of carrying out black-market 'body sculpting' on thousands of women, has been convicted of murder after a botched injection killed Claudia Aderotimi (right) Former madam: Windslowe, a former 'Black Madam' (pictured) had no medical training, using only tips she picked up from overseas doctors who performed her sex change operation and a client of her escort service . Miss Aderotimi, who paid $2,000 to be injected by Windslowe at an airport hotel in 2011, was rushed to hospital after complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. She died just a few hours later. It was later revealed the silicone in her buttocks had moved to her lungs and stopped her heart. During her murder trial, Windslowe said of her 'body sculpting': 'I was the best, and I don't mean that to be cocky,' explaining why celebrities would have sought her out over a licensed plastic surgeon. The 45-year-old described herself as a serial entrepreneur who once ran a transgender escort service, as well as a Gothic hip-hop performer who called herself 'the Black Madam.' Last week, her trial was halted for several days after she was hospitalized with chest pains. She has been in prison since 2012 after an 18-month inquiry led to a homicide ruling and an arrest warrant. The jury got the case Friday. They were choosing between third-degree murder - not premeditated but involves malice - and involuntary manslaughter, involving reckless disregard for a person's life. Aspiring hip-hop artists: Today, the defendant (pictured left and right) was convicted of third-degree murder after Miss Aderotimi, 20, a London dancer and college student, died from a silicone injection in her buttocks . Tragic death: Miss Aderotimi (pictured), who was injected by Windslowe at an airport hotel in the city in 2011, was rushed to hospital after complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. She died a few hours later . In addition to third-degree murder, Windslowe was also convicted of aggravated assault for injuries to a Philadelphia woman who became seriously ill after paying for one of the injections. And the jury found her guilty of two weapons counts - the weapon in question being the industrial-grade silicone. Windslowe faces 20 to 40 years in prison on the murder conviction alone. Miss Aderotimi's family in England chose not to attend the trial. The long-time friend who accompanied her to Philadelphia to celebrate her birthday also declined to make the trip. The friend's 2012 testimony, read aloud in court, described the meeting as 'a touch-up' after their prior visit to the woman they knew as 'Lillian.' Windslowe name-dropped the likes of rappers Nicki Minaj and Kanye West and athlete Serena Williams during her testimony. She also claimed to have been baptized 'Genevieve' by the late Roman Catholic Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua. Amber Rose's agents did return messages seeking comment about the claim she was a client. The evidence showed that Windslowe traveled to hotel rooms and 'pumping parties' with her tools of the trade stuffed into a shiny pink purse: a water bottle filled with silicone, a red plastic cup, needles and syringes, and Krazy Glue to close the injection sites. Claims: Windslowe's colorful testimony during her Philadelphia trial included claims she was 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections' and model Amber Rose (pictured) was 'a walking billboard' for her untrained work . There have been several similar deaths nationwide involving underground buttocks injections. A mother of three who died in Texas after having work done at a tile store died in April 2011. A Columbian couple is serving up to eight years in prison for manslaughter in that case. Windslowe, who went on the run after Miss Aderotimi's death, lowered her head during the closing arguments Friday as a prosecutor described her victim as 'a regular girl' who had asked if the injections could interfere with her ability to have children. When Miss Aderotimi began having chest pains afterward, Windslowe 'kept up that ruse' of being a physician's assistant, Assistant District Attorney Bridget Kirn told the jury last week. 'She put her hand on this young lady's chest as if she were doing an exam,' Kirn said. 'But there was no exam.' Addressing the court, defense lawyer David Rudenstein said the potential dangers of her injections were not clear to his client, Windslowe, because she only knew of satisfied customers. 'Clearly with all the information from this case, we know it shouldn't be done, it's too risky,' Rudenstein told the court. 'We know that now. But we didn't know that then.'", "raw_output": "Padge-Victoria Windslowe convicted of third-degree murder by jury today .\nClient Claudia Aderotimi, 20, died after having silicone injected in buttocks .\nSilicone moved to her lungs and stopped her heart after the 2011 injection .\nWindslowe, 45, arrested in 2012 following an 18-month police investigation .\nDuring trial, she described herself as 'Michelangelo of buttocks injections'\nShe was also found guilty of aggravated assault and two weapons charges .\nShe is facing a lengthy 20 to 40 years in prison on murder conviction alone .", "trunc_input": "An aspiring transgender hip-hop artist who bragged of carrying out black-market 'body sculpting' on thousands of women has been convicted of murder after a botched injection killed a British dancer.

{"raw_input": "Beth Cowan pushed herself to the brink, living on just an apple a day. But now the 19-year-old, from Chester-le-Street, County Durham, has fought back to fitness and is in the running to be crowned Miss British Empire 2015. The brave teenager even took to the stage at a recent beauty contest to tell crowds how she had battled eating disorders and hoped her participation would inspire others fighting the illness. Beth Cowan, 19, of Chester le Street, County Durham, struggled with anorexia and bulimia, at one point tipping the scales at just 6st 3lbs. Now, she is a healthier 8st 2lb (pictured) Beth has fought back to fitness and is currently in the running to be crowned Miss British Empire 2015 . During a Q&A round, she told the host how she'd love to win to send a message of hope to others in the same boat. Beth has now shared a shocking snap of the way she used to look in a bid to convince other young people not to take the path she chose. Beth, who suffered bulimia and anorexia, would spend hours running on a treadmill in her bid to shrink her body to a tiny size. Weighing just 6st 3lb and standing at 5ft 8in, she had a BMI of 13.2 and was classed as dangerously underweight. Beth said: 'I was 16 and still at school. I do not know how it started - there was no specific cause. At 5ft 8in, Claire had a BMI of 13.2 and was classed as dangerously underweight . 'I just started restricting what I ate.

But now the 19-year-old, from Chester-le-Street, County Durham, has fought back to fitness and is in the running to be crowned Miss British Empire 2015. The brave teenager even took to the stage at a recent beauty contest to tell crowds how she had battled eating disorders and hoped her participation would inspire others fighting the illness. Beth Cowan, 19, of Chester le Street, County Durham, struggled with anorexia and bulimia, at one point tipping the scales at just 6st 3lbs. Now, she is a healthier 8st 2lb (pictured) Beth has fought back to fitness and is currently in the running to be crowned Miss British Empire 2015 . During a Q&A round, she told the host how she'd love to win to send a message of hope to others in the same boat. Beth has now shared a shocking snap of the way she used to look in a bid to convince other young people not to take the path she chose.

{"raw_input": "If Uxizandre’s Ryanair Chase success on Thursday is to be AP McCoy’s last Festival win - the 31st of his career - it will stick long in the memory. But, typically, at least for the time being, it will be confined to the recesses of the McCoy memory bank as he fixes his thoughts on the prospect of a fairy-tale end to his Cheltenham career on Friday afternoon. Over breakfast, he might afford himself a smile - of contentment not satisfaction, you don’t win 19 championships being satisfied - as he dares to dream what might be when his Betfred Gold Cup mount, Carlingford Lough, begins his bid for glory shortly after 3.20pm. One thing is certain, the mood will be better at the McCoy table than it was 24 hours earlier. AP McCoy rides Uxizandre to victory in Thursday’s Ryanair Chase for his 31st Cheltenham Festival win . McCoy celebrates with the trophy after his first Festival win of 2015 with his Peadar McCoy by his side . Wife Chanelle admitted the atmosphere had been ‘melancholy’ after two fruitless days amid, no doubt, a creeping fear that things were not going her husband’s way for his last performances on the greatest of jump racing stages. McCoy's wife Chanelle admitted a ‘melancholy’ had come over AP after two winless days but that he was delighted to break his duck on the 16-1 shot . All that changed when 16-1 shot Uxizandre, not even the first string of his trainer Alan King in the Ryanair Chase but transformed by the fitting of a visor, galloped out in front and never looked like being caught as he passed the finishing line five lengths clear of Ma Filleule. Even the crowd seemed stunned at first. The roar took time to grow but by the time McCoy had returned to the winners’ enclosure, they were raising three cheers. After being joined on the winner’s podium by Chanelle, his father Peadar and boss JP McManus, McCoy said: ‘Cheltenham is a very special place. It is where every jockey wants to win and I am no different. These are the days I am going to miss that’s for sure. ‘I had lots of rides coming into the week but did not have any real bankers. ‘You have to keep going race after race and hope one of them wins. That is how my life has normally been, so there is no point changing this week. ‘I was all right. You can try your best to make them go faster but you need the horse — and this horse is very well. ‘I was a bit worried he would not have the stamina to see it out but he got a lot of the others in trouble trying to keep up with him.’ McManus, his ally for a decade, looked as if he derived just as much satisfaction at being able to supply one last winner for his retained jockey as he does landing one of his legendary punts. He said: ‘It is great to have a man like AP on your side. I am just so happy he has had a winner at his last Festival and that we provided it for him makes it even better. JP McManus, AP's ally for a decade, was as delighted for his jockey as he was for his own win . JP said: 'I am so happy he has had a winner at his last Festival ... that we provided it for him makes it better' ‘I remember years ago Christy Roche rang me and said ‘‘Have you seen this young lad ride? He should be handicapped, not the horses’’. ‘I respect AP and love everything he does on and off the racecourse.’ McCoy will wear the green and gold McManus colours on John Kiely-trained Carlingford Lough, as well as his three other four rides on his last day as a jockey at the Festival — Hargam, Princely Conn and Ned Buntline in the concluding Grand Annual Chase which carries his own name. McManus has not ruled out the dream Gold Cup ending . He said: ‘Carlingford Lough has a chance in a very open race. I was hoping he might be good enough. ‘He had a few problems earlier in the season but nothing serious. He improved from the run in the Lexus Chase at Christmas and has a good 10-1 chance of winning in an open Gold Cup.’ There are definitely plenty of dangers — about 17 of them — as few can be ruled out. Defending champion Lord Windermere aims to win at his third consecutive Festival and provide his trainer, Jim Culloty, with a first win under rules since the week after last year’s Gold Cup. A win for last year’s fourth and the form horse of the race, favourite Silviniaco Conti, would also put his trainer Paul Nicholls, who additionally saddles Sam Winner, level with the late Tom Dreaper as a record five-time race winner. McCoy stands with Carlingford Lough after their win in the Hennessey Gold Cup at Leopardstown on February 8. He'll be riding the same mount in the Betfred Gold Cup on Friday shortly after 3.20pm . But his lack of course form is a worry and, the chaotic and close nature of last year’s finish means it is surely better to look at one of the younger first time runners; horses like Noel Meade’s Road To Riches, Oliver Sherwood’s Many Clouds and Jonjo O’Neill’s Holywell, who at one point looked like being McCoy’s mount. Also in that category is the Willie Mullins-trained Djakadam, behind whom there is growing confidence, and Carlingford Lough. But if McManus acknowledged he was unsure if his horse could supply the win everyone craves, he reckons he has found a way to replace his soon- to-retire jockey. ‘We’ve had him cloned,’ he joked.

{"raw_input": "Angel di Maria's old mansion is up for sale - but Manchester United fans need not worry that it means he is on his way out of Old Trafford. The Argentina international has not returned to the £4.15million, luxury six-bedroom pad in the leafy Cheshire village of Prestbury since an attempted break-in at the end of January.

The hall in the mansion will no longer be used by the Di Marias as they have now found somewhere else to live . Angel di Maria's drop in form can be put down to the break-in at his house . But Sportsmail understands the Di Marias are no longer at the hotel and have found more long-term alternative accommodation at the Beetham Tower. The 27-year-old winger rented the stunning property, which features an indoor swimming pool, children's TV room, office, gym, changing rooms and apartment for staff, following his £60m switch to Old Trafford. Last month, Di Maria and his family suffered a 'terrifying raid' while inside the house. The player, who has struggled for form since his move from Spain, was reportedly having dinner with his wife, Jorgelina, and children as crooks tried in vain to smash through his patio doors.The three would-be thieves then fled empty-handed after triggering an alarm system. It is understood the house owner is now looking to sell the property but would be open to renting it again. A source said: 'It was a very unfortunate scenario and something that is very, very rare. The house is absolutely beautiful.' The advert, on Rightmove, states: 'Magnificent mansion set in well-manicured grounds in the heart of Prestbury on a private road. Indoor swimming pool with glass panels into the sitting room and hallway which truly envelopes the pool into the heart of the house.' Di Maria and his family are understood to be staying at the Beetham Tower following the break-in at their former mansion . Di Maria pictured with his wife Jorgelina in November 2014, just weeks before the break-in at his home . Di Maria and his wife Jorgelina attend the FIFA Ballon d'Or ceremony in Zurich in January 2015 together . United assistant Ryan Giggs insists Di Maria is not suffering from a crisis of confidence, however, and expects him to play a major role in their push for FA Cup glory and Champions League qualification. 'I think his confidence is fine,' Giggs said. 'He's a quality player and we'll be looking for him to produce because it is big game after big game now. 'Players get used to different leagues, sometimes quickly and sometimes it takes a bit of time. He had a really good start to the season but with players who take risks and who can win games it's always difficult to be consistent because they will try things that other players won't do. 'They're capable of doing that and that's why they're match-winners and the best players.' Di Maria has been replaced in Manchester United's last two Premier League games before the end .

A photograph of the bathroom in the mansion formerly rented by United's £60m signing Di Maria . Another photograph of the bathroom in the luxury pad that will no longer be rented by Di Maria . The hall in the mansion will no longer be used by the Di Marias as they have now found somewhere else to live . Angel di Maria's drop in form can be put down to the break-in at his house . But Sportsmail understands the Di Marias are no longer at the hotel and have found more long-term alternative accommodation at the Beetham Tower. The 27-year-old winger rented the stunning property, which features an indoor swimming pool, children's TV room, office, gym, changing rooms and apartment for staff, following his £60m switch to Old Trafford. Last month, Di Maria and his family suffered a 'terrifying raid' while inside the house. The player, who has struggled for form since his move from Spain, was reportedly having dinner with his wife, Jorgelina, and children as crooks tried in vain to smash through his patio doors.The three would-be thieves then fled empty-handed after triggering an alarm system. It is understood the house owner is now looking to sell the property but would be open to renting it again. A source said: 'It was a very unfortunate scenario and something that is very, very rare. The house is absolutely beautiful.' The advert, on Rightmove, states: 'Magnificent mansion set in well-manicured grounds in the heart of Prestbury on a private road. Indoor swimming pool with glass panels into the sitting room and hallway which truly envelopes the pool into the heart of the house.' Di Maria and his family are understood to be staying at the Beetham Tower following the break-in at their former mansion . Di Maria pictured with his wife Jorgelina in November 2014, just weeks before the break-in at his home . Di Maria and his wife Jorgelina attend the FIFA Ballon d'Or ceremony in Zurich in January 2015 together . United assistant Ryan Giggs insists Di Maria is not suffering from a crisis of confidence, however, and expects him to play a major role in their push for FA Cup glory and Champions League qualification. 'I think his confidence is fine,' Giggs said. 'He's a quality player and we'll be looking for him to produce because it is big game after big game now. 'Players get used to different leagues, sometimes quickly and sometimes it takes a bit of time. He had a really good start to the season but with players who take risks and who can win games it's always difficult to be consistent because they will try things that other players won't do. 'They're capable of doing that and that's why they're match-winners and the best players.' Di Maria has been replaced in Manchester United's last two Premier League games before the end . Di Maria has seen his form drop off in recent months after making a positive start to his career at Old Trafford .", "trunc_output": "Angel di Maria's rented house was broken in to while he and his

{"raw_input": "Pictures of a terrified teenager being forced to strip naked before being punched and kicked by her classmates have shocked China. The 16-year-old girl can be seen cowering naked in the corner as the group - which is said to have included some of her supposed friends - carry out the vicious onslaught. It is thought she started off wearing a green T-shirt, but as the gang became more frenzied they ripped her clothes from her body in the dormitory of Bancang Middle School, in Bancang township in Funing county in south-western China's Yunnan province. Aggressive: The six-strong group beat the girl after tearing off her clothes in the school dormitory . Clothed: It appears the girl was fully dressed in jeans and a green T-shirt when the attack began . The six-strong group of girls then punch and kick the teenager, before covering her with toothpaste and hacking off her hair, the People's Daily reported. As a final insult, the group then appears to pose with the traumatised teen, who covers her face. And it seems the girls were so proud of their disgusting actions, that they posted the images to China's second biggest social networking site QQ to boast. The apparent ringleader posted the photographs boasting about how she and her pals who are not students at the school had 'Ripped the s**t out of this slut'. Police have identified her as Lu Tung, 16, who went on the run after outraged web users came across the horrifying pictures. Sickening: Later, they posed with the devastated teenager - and then posted the pictures on social media . Torture: The gang - who are now thought to be on the run - also chopped off the girl's hair . Proud: Alleged ringleader Lu Tung boasted on social media they had 'ripped the s***' out of the girl . Lu Tung is now thought to have fled along with the other girls to the crowded city of Guangzhou, in southern China's Guangdong province, which is 850 miles away.

'We are now searching for the girls and for Lu Tang who appears to have been the ring leader.'

{"raw_input": "Tragic: Five-month-old Leo Radcliffe died on June 4 2010, hours after his mother phoned for help . A baby died from meningitis after the on-call doctor asked to examine him failed to turn up and instead left his worried parents a phone message to say he was ‘very busy’, an inquest heard. Leo Radcliffe’s mother had rung NHS Direct after the five-month-old boy was taken ill overnight with a high temperature and heavy breathing. A call handler from the privately run Go-To-Doc scheme passed the call to duty GP Dr Jason Tahghighi with a message saying he needed to visit the family because they had no transport to get to hospital or money for a taxi. Instead of instructing his driver to take him to their address, however, he left two voicemail messages on Leo’s mother’s mobile phone asking her to contact him. When she failed to answer, he assumed the family were asleep and that Leo was OK, made a ‘likely diagnosis’ of a viral illness and concluded that a visit was ‘not necessary’, the hearing was told. But four hours later, Leo developed a tell-tale rash on his forehead, and although his parents called an ambulance he died later in hospital. After being challenged over what happened, Dr Tahghighi initially lied about having attended the house and claimed the lights were switched off when he arrived. He even described the street and area, claiming it was ‘dark’ and ‘scruffy’ before coming clean. His mother, Katie Corry, now 23, told the hearing in Manchester that in the hours before he died in June 2010, Leo had become unsettled and started making a ‘whimpering noise’ while out in his pram. Back at their home in Chadderton, Oldham, he refused food, and she and Leo’s father Kaine Radcliffe, 25, a labourer, noticed a rise in his temperature. She gave him baby paracetamol, but he continued to struggle and was breathing heavily, although there was no sign of a rash. Shortly before midnight she rang the NHS Direct helpline, which has since been replaced by the non-emergency 111 service, and then told a health adviser from Go-To-Doc about Leo’s condition. Miss Corry said Leo felt ‘really, really hot, like boiling hot’. His case was referred to the on-call doctor with the message in capital letters: ‘NO MONEY NO TRANSPORT, VISIT.’ Scroll down for video . 'Lies': Dr Jason Tahghighi, right outside court yesterday, said that he had been to the family home and that he hadn't knocked because the lights were off, it was heard. Left, Leo's parents Katie Corry and Kaine Radcliffe . Leo’s exhausted parents then fell asleep, and when Miss Corry woke up four hours later she realised she had two voicemails. ‘Leo was beside me and I saw a purple rash on his forehead,’ she said. ‘I got a glass and put it on the rash because I knew it was meningitis.’ Symptoms: Leo Radcliffe, pictured, had been suffering a high temperature and heavy breathing . Her partner called an ambulance but Leo died later that day at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital. His family has since received an apology from Go-To-Doc. Dr Tahghighi, 47, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, was later suspended for 12 months for misconduct by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service. His first voicemail message said: ‘We are very busy with visits. Maybe he can wait until the morning.’ The second said: ‘As you haven’t called back I’m assuming that your son Leo is doing OK and settled down. I would suggest a follow-up with your GP some time during open hours. However, I would like you to phone us back with any concerns.’ Dr Tahghighi said that at the time he had been working an ‘excessive number of shifts’, including six that required him to cover if a doctor rang in sick as well as seven days at his surgery in Bramhall and five overnight shifts lasting from 11pm to 7am. When asked if he had been ‘too busy’ to see Leo, he said: ‘I don’t know the reason I didn’t visit. I had the four visits come in at once. ‘I felt with no call back, I just assumed that everything was fine and settled. I should have attended but I was under a considerable amount of stress at the time. I admit working an excessive number of hours.’ The inquest continues.

A baby died from meningitis after the on-call doctor asked to examine him failed to turn up and instead left his worried parents a phone message to say he was ‘very busy’, an inquest heard. Leo Radcliffe’s mother had rung NHS Direct after the five-month-old boy was taken ill overnight with a high temperature and heavy breathing. A call handler from the privately run Go-To-Doc scheme passed the call to duty GP Dr Jason Tahghighi with a message saying he needed to visit the family because they had no transport to get to hospital or money for a taxi. Instead of instructing his driver to take him to their address, however, he left two voicemail messages on Leo’s mother’s mobile phone asking her to contact him. When she failed to answer, he assumed the family were asleep and that Leo was OK, made a ‘likely diagnosis’ of a viral illness and concluded that a visit was ‘not necessary’, the hearing was told. But four hours later, Leo developed a tell-tale rash on his forehead, and although his parents called an ambulance he died later in hospital. After being challenged over what happened, Dr Tahghighi initially lied about having attended the house and claimed the lights were switched off when he arrived. He even described the street and area, claiming it was ‘dark’ and ‘scruffy’ before coming clean. His mother, Katie Corry, now 23, told the hearing in Manchester that in the hours before he died in June 2010, Leo had become unsettled and started making a ‘whimpering noise’ while out in his pram. Back at their home in Chadderton, Oldham, he refused food, and she and Leo’s father Kaine Radcliffe, 25, a labourer, noticed a rise in his temperature. She gave him baby paracetamol, but he continued to struggle and was breathing heavily, although there was no sign of a rash. Shortly before midnight she rang the NHS Direct helpline, which has since been replaced by the non-emergency 111 service, and then told a health adviser from Go-To-Doc about Leo’s condition. Miss Corry said Leo felt ‘really, really hot, like boiling hot’. His case was referred to the on-call doctor with the message in capital letters: ‘NO MONEY NO TRANSPORT, VISIT.’ Scroll down for video .

Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, 25, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting alongside Kurdish forces in the frontline village of Tel Khuzela in Syria. His coffin, which was draped in both the Kurdish flag and the Union Jack, was handed over to his father and uncle in a special ceremony on the Syria-Iraq border yesterday. Scroll down for video .

Mr Scurfield's father (centre) and uncle (left) turned out for the ceremony, which saw hundreds of Syrian Kurds line the streets and wave brightly-coloured flags as the coffin was handed over to the family . Mr Scurfield, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting against ISIS in Syria . Soldiers turned out to form a guard of honour during the procession, while hundreds of Syrian Kurds lined the streets and waved brightly-coloured flags. The former Royal Marine, described as a 'one-man army' who was 'very angry about the Middle East', was hit by mortar fire while battling alongside Kurdish forces near the Syrian city of Qamishli. He is believed to have flown to the region after becoming horrified by the atrocities carried out by ISIS and his fellow fighters said he was the first to volunteer for ambushes and assaults. Prior to his death, he recorded video footage of himself – dressed in army fatigues – in which he said: 'My name is Konstandinos Erik Scurfield. I came here on my own free will and I came here to help.' His family, who live in a detached former farmhouse in Royston, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, were devastated to hear of his death. They were under the impression that he had left Britain in November last year to provide 'medical and humanitarian support' as an expert in battlefield medicine. Shortly after his death, Mr Scurfield's father Chris and uncle travelled out to Syria to try and repatriate his body. A Kurdish women stands beside the body of Mr Scurfield and pays her respects. It is not known when his body will be returned to his hometown in South Yorkshire and the Foreign Office has been unable to confirm . Mr Scurfield's coffin was carried into an ambulance by Kurdish fighters, who had gathered to pay respect . Mr Scurfield's coffin, which was draped in both the Union Jack and Kurdish flags, was taken to Erbil in Iraq . Mr Scurfield's body was taken to the Syrian-Iraqi border by car before being handed over to his family . Mr Scurfield described yesterday's ceremony as 'overwhelming' and said it was 'very special and very comforting' to his family. His son's coffin was draped with the Kurdish and Union Flags and hundreds of people, including Kurdish fighters in the region, watched as it was loaded onto an ambulance to be taken to Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was stopped from joining Kurdish forces last October when he was still a serving Royal Marine. He had been training with the U.S. Marines in California when he made email contact with a Kurdish group and arranged to travel to the frontline. But he was stopped while trying to board a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul, a now well-known jumping off point for Syria, in October and questioned by the American authorities. His one-way ticket rang ‘alarm bells’, officials said, and his luggage, phone and laptop were examined. The Marine, who was known to be outraged by the atrocities committed by the fanatics of ISIS, was also questioned by police on arrival in the UK and then returned to his unit, 45 Commando, in Arbroath, Scotland. It is believed he left the Royal Marines just weeks later. At one point during the procession, a woman dressed in a headscarf offered Mr Scurfield's devastated father support, by pulling him close to her and kissing him on the head. According to the Kurdish Female Fighters page on Facebook, those who gathered at the ceremony chanted ‘slogans of heroism’ as Mr Scurfield’s body was handed back to his family. The group said the chants included: ‘Oh immortal martyr! We swear by your blood, your blood will never be left on the ground, we will take your revenge and we will never forget you. 'With our life and with our blood we are with you, oh martyr.’ Another post by the Facebook group said: ‘The body of British YPG fighter Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, is on the way back to UK. ‘You will never be forgotten, you will always live in our hearts. ‘RIP Hero.’ It is believed that it will be some time before the fighter's body is repatriated to the UK, due to paperwork, and the Foreign Office refused to comment on the matter. Mr Scurfield, who was known as Kosta to his comrades, is the first Briton to be killed while fighting ISIS - also known as Islamic State - in Syria. The former drama student had ambitions to become an actor before joining the Royal Marines, aged 21. However, he fled to Syria to fight alongside the Kurdish forces after becoming 'horrified by the atrocities being carried out by ISIS'. Hundreds of Kurdish women and soldiers turned out for the ceremony yesterday ahead of the repatriation . Mr Scurfield's father and uncle (above) took part in the ceremony yesterday during which their relatives body was handed back to them in a coffin. The body will now be taken to Iraq before being repatriated to the UK . Hundreds of Syrian Kurds attended a ceremony for Konstandinos Erik Scurfield yesterday (pictured), during which his body was handed over to his grieving father and uncle, who had travelled from Britain to the region . Kurdish fighters formed a guard of honour (above) to pay their respects to Mr Scurfield during the ceremony . Mr Scurfield is said to have fled to Syria last November to fight alongside the Kurds against ISIS after becoming 'horrified by the atrocities being carried out' by the terror outfit. He died in mortar fire on March 2 . Mr Scurfield's body was transported to Semalka Gate at the Syria-Iraq border ahead of yesterday's ceremony . His family, including archaeologist parents Chris and Vicci and his student sister Georgianna, said they were heartbroken but proud of him. In a statement following his death they said: 'His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.'

Mr Scurfield, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting against ISIS in Syria . Soldiers turned out to form a guard of honour during the procession, while hundreds of Syrian Kurds lined the streets and waved brightly-coloured flags. The former Royal Marine, described as a 'one-man army' who was 'very angry about the Middle East', was hit by mortar fire while battling alongside Kurdish forces near the Syrian city of Qamishli. He is believed to have flown to the region after becoming horrified by the atrocities carried out by ISIS and his fellow fighters said he was the first to volunteer for ambushes and assaults. Prior to his death, he recorded video footage of himself – dressed in army fatigues – in which he said: 'My name is Konstandinos Erik Scurfield. I came here on my own free will and I came here to help.' His family, who live in a detached former farmhouse in Royston, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, were devastated to hear of his death. They were under the impression that he had left Britain in November last year to provide 'medical and humanitarian support' as an expert in battlefield medicine. Shortly after his death, Mr Scurfield's father Chris and uncle travelled out to Syria to try and repatriate his body. A Kurdish women stands beside the body of Mr Scurfield and pays her respects. It is not known when his body will be returned to his hometown in South Yorkshire and the Foreign Office has been unable to confirm . Mr Scurfield's coffin was carried into an ambulance by Kurdish fighters, who had gathered to pay respect . Mr Scurfield's coffin, which was draped in both the Union Jack and Kurdish flags, was taken to Erbil in Iraq . Mr Scurfield's body was taken to the Syrian-Iraqi border by car before being handed over to his family . Mr Scurfield described yesterday's ceremony as 'overwhelming' and said it was 'very special and very comforting' to his family. His son's coffin was draped with the Kurdish and Union Flags and hundreds of people, including Kurdish fighters in the region, watched as it was loaded onto an ambulance to be taken to Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was stopped from joining Kurdish forces last October when he was still a serving Royal Marine. He had been training with the U.S. Marines in California when he made email contact with a Kurdish group and arranged to travel to the frontline. But he was stopped while trying to board a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul, a now well-known jumping off point for Syria, in October and questioned by the American authorities. His one-way ticket rang ‘alarm bells’, officials said, and his luggage, phone and laptop were examined. The Marine, who was known to be outraged by the atrocities committed by the fanatics of ISIS, was also questioned by police on arrival in the UK and then returned to his unit, 45 Commando, in Arbroath, Scotland. It is believed he left the Royal Marines just weeks later. At one point during the procession, a woman dressed in a headscarf offered Mr Scurfield's devastated father support, by pulling him close to her and kissing him on the head. According to the Kurdish Female Fighters page on Facebook, those who gathered at the ceremony chanted ‘slogans of heroism’ as Mr Scurfield’s body was handed back to his family. The group said the chants included: ‘Oh immortal martyr! We swear by your blood, your blood will never be left on the ground, we will take your revenge and we will never forget you. 'With our life and with our blood we are with you, oh martyr.’ Another post by the Facebook group said: ‘The body of British YPG fighter Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, is on the way back to UK. ‘You will never be forgotten, you will always live in our hearts. ‘RIP Hero.’ It is believed that it will be some time before the fighter's body is repatriated to the UK, due to paperwork, and the Foreign Office refused to comment on the matter. Mr Scurfield, who was known as Kosta to his comrades, is the first Briton to be killed while fighting ISIS - also known as Islamic State - in Syria. The former drama student had ambitions to become an actor before joining the Royal Marines, aged 21. However, he fled to Syria to fight alongside the Kurdish forces after becoming 'horrified by the atrocities being carried out by ISIS'. Hundreds of Kurdish women and soldiers turned out for the ceremony yesterday ahead of the repatriation . Mr Scurfield's father and uncle (above) took part in the ceremony yesterday during which their relatives body was handed back to them in a coffin. The body will now be taken to Iraq before being repatriated to the UK . Hundreds of Syrian Kurds attended a ceremony for Konstandinos Erik Scurfield yesterday (pictured), during which his body was handed over to his grieving father and uncle, who had travelled from Britain to the region . Kurdish fighters formed a guard of honour (above) to pay their respects to Mr Scurfield during the ceremony . Mr Scurfield is said to have fled to Syria last November to fight alongside the Kurds against ISIS after becoming 'horrified by the atrocities being carried out' by the terror outfit. He died in mortar fire on March 2 . Mr Scurfield's body was transported to Semalka Gate at the Syria-Iraq border ahead of yesterday's ceremony . His family, including archaeologist parents Chris and Vicci and his student sister Georgianna, said they were heartbroken but proud of him. In a statement following his death they said: 'His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.'

{"raw_input": "A French teacher from Florida has been suspended for five days without pay after she was accused of calling her 14-year-old Muslim student a 'raghead Taliban' when he walked into class wearing a hoodie. The administrative complaint filed against Maria Valdes also claimed that, when the teacher called on on  Deyab-Houssein Wardani, she once asked 'Okay the Taliban, what is the answer?' It also alleged that the Cypress Bay High School teacher would say 'Ah no! The Taliban is here' when he walked into the classroom and would refer to him as a 'terrorista,' which is Spanish for terrorist. Scroll down for video . A French teacher from Florida has been suspended for five days without pay for allegedly calling her 14-year-old Muslim student Deyab-Houssein Wardani (pictured) a 'raghead Taliban' Deyab-Houssein, who did not know the Taliban referred to a terrorist organization until he asked his parents, said the other students in his class laughed at the nickname. 'I would not expect this from a teacher, teachers are supposed to set an example for their students,' he told the Sun Sentinel. 'It's very sad that people still think like that, that all Muslims are your average daily terrorist.' Valdes will also have to undergo a diversity training program. The punishment is not enough for Deyab-Houssein's father Youssef, who said that, at a minimum, he believes the teacher should have been suspended for a year without pay - if not fired. Wardani said the five-day suspension amounted to a 'vacation'. He made his anger loud and clear after the punishment was passed down at the Broward School Board's meeting on Tuesday. The father told school administrations they should 'all be removed for bullying,' according to Local 10. Superintendent Robert W. Runcie, who filed the administrative complaint after he was notified of Valdes' alleged comments, said the matter was taken 'very seriously' and was addressed with the 'appropriate sense of urgency'. 'I take a lot of exception to any statement, or suggestion that somehow this administration and school board did nothing or was ever lax in our response', he said, according to the Miami Herald. The punishment is not enough for Deyab-Houssein's father Youssef, who said that, at a minimum, he believes the teacher should have been suspended for a year without pay - if not fired . During the meeting Runcie, a Jamaican immigrant, said that he had personally been affected by racism. He shared the story of when he watched his mother get shot in the face by a man who blamed Jamaican immigrants for his inability to get a job. Wardani said this was not the first time his son, who is half Lebanese and half Moroccan, has experienced discrimination. In the fourth-grade a school bus driver who knew Deyab-Houssein was Muslim told him 'we're going to wipe you off the face of this planet and turn you into dust and sand,' Wardani told the Sun Sentinel. Although the school board voted unanimously to discipline the teacher, Wardani was not done fighting after the meeting was over. 'I promise you for the rest of my life, until my dying breath, I'm going to make sure no child goes through what my Deyab-Houssein had to go through,' said Wardani, who has reached out to the FBI . 'This is motivating me to work harder,' Deyab-Houssein said. 'To prove that I am not a random guy who you can call a Taliban' 'I promise you for the rest of my life, until my dying breath, I'm going to make sure no child goes through what my Deyab-Houssein had to go through,' he told the Miami Herald. Wardani said he has reached out to the FBI. District administrators said the degree of punishment that could be leveled against Valdes was limited because of an agreement with the Teachers Union. As for Deyab-Houssein, he said he is 'very proud' of his father and is getting support from his peers, but that he now feels a 'strange vibe' from his French teacher, 'like she doesn't want me to be there.'

It also alleged that the Cypress Bay High School teacher would say 'Ah no! The Taliban is here' when he walked into the classroom and would refer to him as a 'terrorista,' which is Spanish for terrorist. Scroll down for video . A French teacher from Florida has been suspended for five days without pay for allegedly calling her 14-year-old Muslim student Deyab-Houssein Wardani (pictured) a 'raghead Taliban' Deyab-Houssein, who did not know the Taliban referred to a terrorist organization until he asked his parents, said the other students in his class laughed at the nickname. 'I would not expect this from a teacher, teachers are supposed to set an example for their students,' he told the Sun Sentinel. 'It's very sad that people still think like that, that all Muslims are your average daily terrorist.' Valdes will also have to undergo a diversity training program. The punishment is not enough for Deyab-Houssein's father Youssef, who said that, at a minimum, he believes the teacher should have been suspended for a year without pay - if not fired. Wardani said the five-day suspension amounted to a 'vacation'. He made his anger loud and clear after the punishment was passed down at the Broward School Board's meeting on Tuesday. The father told school administrations they should 'all be removed for bullying,' according to Local 10. Superintendent Robert W. Runcie, who filed the administrative complaint after he was notified of Valdes' alleged comments, said the matter was taken 'very seriously' and was addressed with the 'appropriate sense of urgency'. 'I take a lot of exception to any statement, or suggestion that somehow this administration and school board did nothing or was ever lax in our response', he said, according to the Miami Herald. The punishment is not enough for Deyab-Houssein's father Youssef, who said that, at a minimum, he believes the teacher should have been suspended for a year without pay - if not fired . During the meeting Runcie, a Jamaican immigrant, said that he had personally been affected by racism. He shared the story of when he watched his mother get shot in the face by a man who blamed Jamaican immigrants for his inability to get a job. Wardani said this was not the first time his son, who is half Lebanese and half Moroccan, has experienced discrimination. In the fourth-grade a school bus driver who knew Deyab-Houssein was Muslim told him 'we're going to wipe you off the face of this planet and turn you into dust and sand,' Wardani told the Sun Sentinel. Although the school board voted unanimously to discipline the teacher, Wardani was not done fighting after the meeting was over. 'I promise you for the rest of my life, until my dying breath, I'm going to make sure no child goes through what my Deyab-Houssein had to go through,' said Wardani, who has reached out to the FBI . 'This is motivating me to work harder,' Deyab-Houssein said. 'To prove that I am not a random guy who you can call a Taliban' 'I promise you for the rest of my life, until my dying breath, I'm going to make sure no child goes through what my Deyab-Houssein had to go through,' he told the Miami Herald. Wardani said he has reached out to the FBI. District administrators said the degree of punishment that could be leveled against Valdes was limited because of an agreement with the Teachers Union. As for Deyab-Houssein, he said he is 'very proud' of his father and is getting support from his peers, but that he now feels a 'strange vibe' from his French teacher, 'like she doesn't want me to be there.'

{"raw_input": "Precocious amateur CiCi Bellis says she's ready to take on the best of the pros - Serena Williams. Bellis, a 15-year-old American who made a big splash at last year's U.S. Open, advanced Friday to a potential third-round match against Williams by beating Zarina Diyas 6-2, 6-1. Williams' second-round match Friday night against Monica Niculescu was postponed until Saturday because of rain. But Bellis was already relishing the chance to take on the 19-time Grand Slam champion. Catherine \"CiCi' Bellis of the United States, pictured at the US OPen this summer, advannced at the Miami Open on Friday and may have a chance to go against Serena Williams . 'It's going to be really fun,' Bellis said. 'I have nothing to lose, so I'm just going to play my game and see what happens.' Sloane Stephens won an all-American match on the stadium court, converting five of six break-point chances to beat No. 17 Madison Keys 6-4, 6-2. It was the first meeting between the two Fed Cup teammates, and Keys teared up near the end of her loss. 'I just kind of let the emotions get to me,' the 20-year-old Keys said. 'It's like you're having a really terrible day, but my terrible day is in front of hundreds of people and then broadcast on TV. That's not always fun.' New opponent?: CiCi Bellis Bellis is already relishing the chance to take on the 19-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams (pictured) after her recent win against Zarina Diyas . No. 2-seeded Rafael Nadal, showing no ill effects from an ankle injury suffered in practice Monday, defeated fellow Spaniard Nicolas Almagro 6-4, 6-2. 'I am well,' Nadal said. 'The day after, I had pain, but after two days I improved 50 percent. It's not limiting my movements.' Others advancing in the women's draw included No. 3 Simona Halep, the titlist last week at Indian Wells. She won 6-4, 2-6, 6-1 against wild card Nicole Vaidisova, a two-time Grand Slam semifinalist mounting a comeback from two shoulder operations. Two-time champion Andy Murray beat American Donald Young 6-4, 6-2. Other men's winners included No. 7 Stan Wawrinka, No. 8 Tomas Berdych and No. 25 Bernard Tomic. American Sam Querrey had 19 aces but lost to No. 15 Kevin Anderson 6-7 (5), 7-6 (3), 6-4. No. 10 Feliciano Lopez was eliminated by Dominic Thiem, 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-3. Four-time champion Novak Djokovic lost in doubles and plays his opening singles match Saturday night. 'Hopefully I can have another great week in Miami,' Djokovic said. Zarina Diyas of Kazakhstan shakes hands with Catherine \"CiCi' Bellis of the United States at the US Open last year and on Friday at the Miami Open Bellis beat Diyas 6-2, 6-1 . 'Some of my best tennis I have played here in these courts.' Two-time champion Victoria Azarenka reached the third round by beating No. 20 Jelena Jankovic 6-1, 6-1. Azarenka faced 13 break points and saved them all. 'I stayed composed,' Azarenka said. 'I was very sure what I had to do, and I was really executing that.' Bellis became the youngest player to win a match at the U.S. Open since 1996 when she upset 12th-seeded Dominika Cibulkova last August. Suddenly a celebrity, Bellis then lost to Diyas in the second round. She avenged that defeat Friday with much less fanfare. 'This one I think I played a lot smarter,' Bellis said. Oppents: Zarina Diyas of Kazakhstan returns a shot against Catherine \"CiCi' Bellis of the United Statesduring their women's singles second round match on Day Four of the 2014 US Open last year . 'At the U.S. Open I was really like caught up in all the kind of hype that was going on. But this one I was just really focused and played my game. I think I did what I needed to do to win really well.' The Californian has yet to turn pro, and the Miami Open is her biggest tournament since the U.S. Open. She made the draw as a wild card and played Friday on remote Court 9, but she'll be on the stadium court Sunday if she faces Williams, who has won Key Biscayne a record seven times. Intimidating? Bellis says no. 'We are all in the same tournament, so we are all kind of at this level,' she said. 'You can't really think about who you're playing. It's just a ball that's coming back on the other side of the court. You just have to go out and not think about that stuff and just play your game. That's what I'm planning to do.'", "raw_output": "CiCi Bellis, a 15-year-old American, advanced on Friday to a potential third-round match against Serena Williams by beating Zarina Diyas 6-2, 6-1 .\n'I have nothing to lose, so I'm just going to play my game and see what happens,' said of her potential match with Serena Williams .\n'You can't really think about who you're playing.

She made the draw as a wild card and played Friday on remote Court 9, but she'll be on the stadium court Sunday if she faces Williams, who has won Key Biscayne a record seven times. Intimidating? Bellis says no. 'We are all in the same tournament, so we are all kind of at this level,' she said. 'You can't really think about who you're playing.

{"raw_input": "A police mugshot of Mukesh Singh: One of four men convicted for the rape and murder of Jyoti Singh, he says women are 'far more responsible' for rape . A man who took part in the notorious gang rape and murder of a medical student in Delhi blames her for the attack, saying 'you can't clap with one hand - it takes two.' 'A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night,' said Mukesh Singh, one of four men condemned to death for the hideous sex attack that shocked the world two years ago. 'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes. 'About 20 per cent of girls are good.' The depraved murder of Jyoti Singh in December 2012 sparked revulsion across the world as well as a wave of protests in India, where people demanded a change in attitudes towards women. The 23-year-old student had been returning from a cinema with a male friend on a Sunday evening when she accepted a lift from the off-duty charter bus. Once inside, bus driver Mukesh Singh, his brother Ram, gym instructor Vinay Sharma, 20, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and an unnamed teenager subjected to a horrific rape. She died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen, genitals and intestines. Jyoti's death sparked a period of deep soul searching in India, where equal rights for women are enshrined in the constitution but rarely effective in practise. But even today, Mukesh Singh remains unrepentant. In an in-depth interview with filmmaker Leslee Udwin, as part of a documentary to be broadcast on BBC Four, he blamed Jyoti for daring to fight back against her attackers. 'When being raped, she shouldn't fight back. She should just be silent and allow the rape,' he said. 'Then they'd have dropped her off after \"doing her\", and only hit [her friend] the boy.' His impending execution, he suggests, is a foolish move that will only endanger future rape victims. 'The death penalty will make things even more dangerous for girls,' he said. 'Now when they rape, they won't leave the girl like we did. They will kill her. 'Before, they would rape and say, \"Leave her, she won't tell anyone.\" Now when they rape, especially the criminal types, they will just kill the girl. Death.' Mukesh Singh and his accomplices treated Jyoti no better. After luring her aboard the bus, they took turns raping her and beat her with an iron rod when frantically tried to fight them off. Two blood stained metal rods were later retrieved from the bus; medical staff confirmed that 'it was penetration by this that caused massive damage to her genitals, uterus and intestines'. And after the rapists had enough, rather than 'dropping her off' they threw her and her friend from the moving bus. Mukesh Singh then allegedly tried to run them over, but her friend had enough strength left to pull Jyoti out of the way. Despite efforts to get her the best medical care, even flying her to a hospital in Singapore, Jyoti died 13 days later, having suffered brain damage, pneumonia, and abdominal infection. Doctors had already been forced to remove most of her intestine. Protest: Jyoti's death sparked outrage in India with many taking to the New Delhi streets to demand better protection for women and a change in a culture which sees them as second-class citizens . Anger: Protestors had given Jyoti - whose name was at that point still barred from release - the name Damini after a Bollywood film of the same name where the protagonist fought for justice after a rape ordeal . Outrage: Protestors hold candles in New Delhi during a night vigil following the 23-year-old student's gang-rape and murder. It was this outpouring that inspired the documentary about Jyoti's death . For filmmaker Ms Udwin it was not the horror of the attack that compelled her to make her documentary, but the outpouring of anger in India at the social conditions that allowed it to happen. 'When news of this gang-rape hit our TV screens in December 2012, I was as shocked and upset as we all are when faced with such brazen abandon of the norms of ‘civilised’ society,' she said. 'But what actually inspired me to commit to the harrowing and difficult journey of making this film was the optimism occasioned by the reports that followed the rape. 'Courageous and impassioned ordinary men and women of India braved the December freeze to protest in unprecedented numbers, withstanding an onslaught of teargas shells, lathi charges and water canons, to make heard their cry of \"enough is enough\". 'In this regard, India led the world by example. In my lifetime, I can’t recall any other country standing up with such commitment and determination for women’s rights.' Mukesh Singh, who denies raping Jyoti but admitted driving the bus where she was attacked, and three others are currently awaiting the outcome of appeals against their convictions. His brother Ram, widely considered leader of the group, was found dead in his cell in March 2013. The fifth, juvenile perpetrator was also convicted of rape and murder and sentenced to three years in a reform facility.

A man who took part in the notorious gang rape and murder of a medical student in Delhi blames her for the attack, saying 'you can't clap with one hand - it takes two.' 'A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night,' said Mukesh Singh, one of four men condemned to death for the hideous sex attack that shocked the world two years ago. 'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes. 'About 20 per cent of girls are good.' The depraved murder of Jyoti Singh in December 2012 sparked revulsion across the world as well as a wave of protests in India, where people demanded a change in attitudes towards women. The 23-year-old student had been returning from a cinema with a male friend on a Sunday evening when she accepted a lift from the off-duty charter bus. Once inside, bus driver Mukesh Singh, his brother Ram, gym instructor Vinay Sharma, 20, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and an unnamed teenager subjected to a horrific rape. She died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen, genitals and intestines. Jyoti's death sparked a period of deep soul searching in India, where equal rights for women are enshrined in the constitution but rarely effective in practise. But even today, Mukesh Singh remains unrepentant. In an in-depth interview with filmmaker Leslee Udwin, as part of a documentary to be broadcast on BBC Four, he blamed Jyoti for daring to fight back against her attackers. 'When being raped, she shouldn't fight back. She should just be silent and allow the rape,' he said. 'Then they'd have dropped her off after \"doing her\", and only hit [her friend] the boy.' His impending execution, he suggests, is a foolish move that will only endanger future rape victims. 'The death penalty will make things even more dangerous for girls,' he said. 'Now when they rape, they won't leave the girl like we did. They will kill her. 'Before, they would rape and say, \"Leave her, she won't tell anyone.\" Now when they rape, especially the criminal types, they will just kill the girl. Death.' Mukesh Singh and his accomplices treated Jyoti no better. After luring her aboard the bus, they took turns raping her and beat her with an iron rod when frantically tried to fight them off. Two blood stained metal rods were later retrieved from the bus; medical staff confirmed that 'it was penetration by this that caused massive damage to her genitals, uterus and intestines'. And after the rapists had enough, rather than 'dropping her off' they threw her and her friend from the moving bus. Mukesh Singh then allegedly tried to run them over, but her friend had enough strength left to pull Jyoti out of the way. Despite efforts to get her the best medical care, even flying her to a hospital in Singapore, Jyoti died 13 days later, having suffered brain damage, pneumonia, and abdominal infection. Doctors had already been forced to remove most of her intestine. Protest: Jyoti's death sparked outrage in India with many taking to the New Delhi streets to demand better protection for women and a change in a culture which sees them as second-class citizens . Anger: Protestors had given Jyoti - whose name was at that point still barred from release - the name Damini after a Bollywood film of the same name where the protagonist fought for justice after a rape ordeal . Outrage: Protestors hold candles in New Delhi during a night vigil following the 23-year-old student's gang-rape and murder. It was this outpouring that inspired the documentary about Jyoti's death . For filmmaker Ms Udwin it was not the horror of the attack that compelled her to make her documentary, but the outpouring of anger in India at the social conditions that allowed it to happen. 'When news of this gang-rape hit our TV screens in December 2012, I was as shocked and upset as we all are when faced with such brazen abandon of the norms of ‘civilised’ society,' she said. 'But what actually inspired me to commit to the harrowing and difficult journey of making this film was the optimism occasioned by the reports that followed the rape. 'Courageous and impassioned ordinary men and women of India braved the December freeze to protest in unprecedented numbers, withstanding an onslaught of teargas shells, lathi charges and water canons, to make heard their cry of \"enough is enough\". 'In this regard, India led the world by example. In my lifetime, I can’t recall any other country standing up with such commitment and determination for women’s rights.' Mukesh Singh, who denies raping Jyoti but admitted driving the bus where she was attacked, and three others are currently awaiting the outcome of appeals against their convictions. His brother Ram, widely considered leader of the group, was found dead in his cell in March 2013. The fifth, juvenile perpetrator was also convicted of rape and murder and sentenced to three years in a reform facility.

{"raw_input": "Mark Cavendish has issued a typically blunt assessment of the Cycling Independent Reform Commission report into past practices of doping and suggested Lance Armstrong's charity return to the Tour de France 'could be done in a different environment'. CIRC was established to investigate whether the UCI, cycling's world governing body, was complicit in past doping practices, such as the Armstrong affair, which saw the American stripped of his seven Tour titles and banned for life. Some of the reports findings were scathing but, according to 2011 world champion and 25-time Tour stage winner Cavendish, little was revelatory. Mark Cavendish says there were few revelations in the Cycling Independent Reform Commission report . The 25-time Tour de France stage winner said the report was 'all the s*** that's been out there the last few years just compiled into the one document' Cavendish, speaking after announcing he'll compete in August's Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic, said: 'To be brutally honest, I don't really think there's anything new in there. 'There's all the s*** that's been out there the last few years just compiled into the one document. 'People talk about the past of cycling like it's the present. It's a little bit frustrating; that would be an understatement. 'As long as cycling's cleaning up and I'm racing in a fair playing field in a sport I love, then I'll continue to be happy with that.' One unnamed but 'respected' professional cyclist told CIRC that 90 per cent of the professional peloton continues to dope, while another reported the figure was 20 per cent. Cavendish doesn't see much use in the report, commissioned by new UCI president Brian Cookson . Cavendish did not confirm if he had read the report in full or just the media dispatches which followed its publication earlier this month. He did not speak to CIRC and was unaware that riders could approach the commission to share their views. Asked if he felt the report represented the views of the modern peloton, Cavendish said: 'Absolutely not. I really don't. I wasn't asked at all to say anything. 'Ninety-five per cent of the peloton will know the one rider who will have said certain comments and the other five per cent won't have raced or known that rider, so couldn't comment on it. 'I think certain quotes from unreliable sources don't really mean anything and completely warp the sense of the whole process.' Armstrong plans to return to the Tour alongside former footballer Geoff Thomas, another cancer survivor. Lance Armstrong (left) plans to return to the Tour de France, the event for which he was stripped of seven titles due to doping, as part of a charity ride with former footballer Geoff Thomas . Thomas is riding the Tour route one day ahead of the professional peloton, which includes Cavendish, to raise funds for charity and has invited Armstrong to join him.

{"raw_input": "Captain of St Mirren at 17 the course of Tony Fitzpatrick’s life altered on a January morning in 1983. The day he lost his six-year-old son. His previous existence had been blinkered, revolving around the mainstays of family, football and faith. His family was shattered by the death of son Anthony following a two year battle with acute myeloid leukaemia. Somehow, the football and faith - subjected to anguished, grief stricken examinations in the months which followed - survived. “I have always believed in God\" reflects Fitzpatrick, sipping fizzy water in a coffee shop in Glasgow's west end. “But what happened to little Tony made me angry. I wondered how something like that could happen. Tony Fitzpatrick wants his book to serve as a legacy for the six-year-old son he lost to leukaemia . “It challenged my faith for a wee spell. It challenged how I felt. “There was anger, bitterness, every emotion you might associate with bereavement. “I just couldn’t understand why God had done it. Even to this day I still ask myself the question.” He sought refuge and answers in writing. Scribbled notes on his experiences and emotions became a habit. The outcome of his jottings is ‘The Promise, Together Again’, the 59-year-old’s first book. It features the adventures of Babakoochi Bear, the pet name he used for the son lost 32 years ago. The memories are undimmed by the passage of time. He remembers the awful weather most. Through the grey clouds and rain enveloping Glasgow’s Hospital for Sick Children he grasped for a silver lining. “I always remember my wife and I coming out to the car park after Tony died and there being most stunning rainbow I had ever seen. “Maybe I was looking for something. But the colours were so vibrant, it was stunning. To me it was a sign. A sign of.... something.\" A committed, church goer he interpreted the rainbow as a token of hope. Some kind of message from above. Yet in the months which followed he examined his faith and found it wanting. Rationalising what kind of kind of God might take the life of an innocent six-year-old child proved impossible. An uneasy, restless peace descended slowly. “Listen, after a time faith became a great comfort again. You don’t know where it comes from. But when you are in despair your beliefs offer you peace and help when you need it most. “But was that challenged for a time? Yes. Yes, it was. They say time is a healer. You hear that all the time. And it probably is to some degree. “But when you lose a child you never ever get over it. “You learn to live with it. But that’s all. “Tony died in 1983. But every day he is with me in my life. “I feel him all the time in the room. “I can sit with my eyes closed in a quiet space and I don’t see him. But I take comfort from the fact I feel he is there. “It never gets any easier. There are times all these years on when I still break down for no reason.” Former St Mirren captain Fitzpatrick (right) in action for his club against Celtic . When religion was no comfort for his loss, professional football filled the void. Fitzpatrick was just 24 when his child’s illness was diagnosed and 26 when he died. In the course of two and a half years maturity was thrust upon his shoulders in brutal fashion. “I had been very, very selfish,” he reflects now. “What the illness of my son did was make me realise there were things in life more important than football. “For 90 minutes you would play and then as soon as the game was over it was ‘right, I have to get to the hospital.’ “Ach, I still played after he died. But something was missing.” His career, until then, had been on an upward trajectory. He started under Sir Alex Ferguson at Love Street, appointed skipper as a teenager, before a move to Bristol City, where Roy Hodgson was the manager . He returned to Paisley after two years, flirting with a Scotland cap and winning a Scottish Cup winners’ medal in 1987. Fitzpatrick managed St Mirren twice and remains a respected, likable figure in Scottish football. His 642 appearances for St Mirren make him a club icon, yet grief took a yard from his legs. “I always tried my best. I played in a good St Mirren team with guys like McAvennie, Frank McDougal and Peter Weir – really good players. “We had good teams, we were in Europe and we won a Scottish Cup. “But I had always had a deep desire to be the best player I could be. When Tony took ill it wasn’t the same. “I remember beating Celtic 3-1 and things were going great. It was looking good. And then ‘bang.’ “He had been unwell for a couple of weeks. One night he was really bad and I came down for training the next morning and saw he wasn’t right. “I went back to the doctor and told him Tony had purple spots. That’s when the alarm bells rung. “Within minutes of taking him in we were sent to Yorkhill Sick Kids’ hospital. “He had septicaemia, meningitis and then they found the leukaemia. His prospects were awful. “We spent all our time in Yorkhill. We slept there. “In the course of two and a half years we had Tony at home for no more than three months.” Tuesdays and Thursdays were spent donating blood to improve the quality of his son’s remaining days. With Elizabeth went on to have another boy and a set of twins before the couple went their separate ways. A product of the West of Scotland before counselling became the fashiom, however, Fitzpatrick found it difficult to express himself beyond the football pitch. He wasn't the only one. “I remember when little Tony died that neighbours and friends didn’t know what to say to us. “They would cross the road because they couldn’t deal with it. “I was very conscious of it and later they would explain they didn’t want to cry or break down. “My daughter was nine when it all happened and I regret that I couldn’t express my feelings to her either. “The little soul was left to cope because I couldn’t speak about it. “It occurred to me then that a book might be a way of breaking down the barrier.” Babakoochi Bear, the star of ‘The Promise, Together Again’, dedicates himself to pursuing peace on earth while adressing the themes of grief, loss and the rainbow which appeared over Yorkhill in January 83.. Fitzpatrick concedes that writing was also a form of catharsis. His way of finding some inner peace. “People feel their grief in different ways,” he admits. “I’m not educated in any way, but I started to jot down ideas about Babakoochi Bear and that developed. “I waited a long time – but this was the right time. I had a huge urge to do it.” An initial print run of 1000 books, with professional illustrations, cost money and when it sells out Fitzpatrick will use the funds to print more. Further stories of Babakoochi Bear’s travails bulge from notebooks in his Glasgow home and the Waterstones branch closest to Paisley have agreed to stock the book aimed at 7-11 year olds. “I did it for Tony,” explains Fitzpatrick. “Listen, he was a normal wee boy – he could be a wee nightmare at times like any child. “But he made a big impact on a lot of people in a short time. And more than anything I want this book to serve as his legacy.” ‘The Promise; Together Again’ by Tony Fitzpatrick is available from www.babakoochibear.com .", "raw_output": "Tony Fitzpatrick lost his six-year-old son in 1983 after a leukaemia battle .\nFitzpatrick is a former captain and manager of St Mirren .\nThe 59-year-old has released his first book 'The Promise, Together Again'", "trunc_input": "Captain of St Mirren at 17 the course of Tony Fitzpatrick’s life altered on a January morning in 1983.

{"raw_input": "The mother of comedian Tracey Ullman has been killed in a fire caused by the 'careless disposal' of a cigarette. Mrs Ullman has been left 'deeply saddened' after discovering Doreen Skinner died in the fire at her ground-floor retirement flat in Holtspur, Buckinghamshire, on Monday. The 85-year-old was discovered by firefighters around 11.20pm. The comedian allegedly visited the building - which has 28 flats for the over 55s - on Thursday to survey the damage, according to residents. Earlier this month it was revealed Mrs Ullman - left in 1982, right in January this year - is to make a new six-part BBC One series, The Tracey Ullman Show, almost 30 years after she moved across the Atlantic . She became a huge star in the UK and the United States in the 1980s. Earlier this month it was revealed the 55-year-old is to make a new six-part BBC One series, The Tracey Ullman Show, almost 30 years after she moved across the Atlantic. A spokesman for Mrs Ullman today said: 'Tracey and her family are deeply saddened by the death of her mother, Doreen. 'The family would like to thank everyone for the kind messages they have received and ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult time.' Mrs Ullman, who was born in Slough, Berkshire, described her mother in a previous interview as 'very funny'. She said: 'My mother was always doing strange things like driving parts around for a garage, all covered in oil. 'But she was very funny and our defence against hardship was having a great sense of humour. 'Mum worked in a laboratory, testing food, and would bring home samples for our dinner. Sometimes she'd have to report that formula X had been found unfit for human consumption.' One of Mrs Skinner's neighbours said: 'The fire started in the middle of the night and the poor lady died. We are all very shocked.' Another added: 'One of her daughters was here. I don't know if it was Tracey Ullman because I didn't see her myself.' A spokesman for Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that a cigarette had started the fire in the bedroom late on Monday night. 'Crews from Beaconsfield and High Wycombe were called to an address in Kiln Court at 11.21pm after an automatic fire alarm activated. The fire had started in the bedroom. 'Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus entered the flat and dealt with the fire and discovered a body. The flat is one of 28 designed for over 55s in the area. Its windows are still blacked out from the smoke (above) 'Investigations  have concluded that this fire was caused by careless disposal of cigarettes. 'This covers a number of scenarios, including falling asleep while smoking and not putting cigarettes out properly.' Roger Brinklow, group commander at the rescue service, added: 'Our thoughts are with her family and friends, and the local community.'

{"raw_input": "Once he had come round after emergency surgery, Ben Morgan asked the surgeon two pressing questions; would he ever play again and if so, could he make it back in time for the World Cup? Mercifully for the Gloucester and England No 8 – who had shattered his leg in a match against Saracens the previous night – the answer to both was 'yes'. But that was just the theory; the practice involves relentless determination and dedication, including endless hours in a hyperbaric chamber, where the 26-year-old is mastering the art of sketching while wearing an oxygen mask. No stone is left unturned in Morgan's quest to regain full fitness in time to be part of the national squad for the global gathering in September and October. There are no guarantees he will be ready, but despite the magnitude of his injury, the signs are good and he is infused with optimism. Ben Morgan is undergoing sessions in a hyperbaric chamber to speed up his recovery from a fractured leg . Morgan has been out of action since he injured his leg playing against Saracens in January . Morgan was named England's player of the series following his superb displays during the November Tests . He simply has to take part in the tournament, and help the hosts excel, because the final takes place on his mother's birthday and she would like her son to mark it in style! On January 9, Morgan was driving for the line during an Aviva Premiership match at Kingsholm when his season was crudely terminated. He heard the sounds of breaking bone, and when team-mates and opponents moved sharply away as he lay on the ground, he knew he was in real trouble. 'All I remember was that we had a scrum in the left-hand corner, I picked up the ball and went on a usual run,' he told Sportsmail. 'I got tackled by Jacques Burger and having looked back at the clips, I was able to see he wrapped his legs around my leg and I didn't really have anywhere to go. 'At the time, I didn't really know what the hell had happened and I just started yelping. I like to think I wouldn't make those noises unless it was serious! People moved out of the way pretty quickly and even though I wasn't in that much pain, I knew I had done something. Gloucester No 8 Morgan lines up London Welsh fly half Olly Barkley at the Kassam Stadium . 'I just didn't know how bad it was going to be, but I had an immediate realisation that I was going to be out for a while. When I got to the hospital, the staff were pretty guarded, but I got more of a sense of how bad things were when a few hours had passed.' A surgeon from Cheltenham came to the hospital in Gloucester to perform the operation during the night and when the anaesthetic wore off, Morgan sought to put his mind at rest about his predicament. 'When I'd come round, I fired loads of questions at the surgeon,' he said. 'The first thing was 'Is it a career-ender?'. I knew he couldn't be precise, but I needed a ball-park idea of how long I'd be out for and he told me six months.' The damaged leg contained a significant amount of precious metal; to help the healing process. He will have another operation next month to replace a pin with more flexible wire, but a plate will remain in place. Morgan has not yet had a chance to set off airport scanners, but he quipped: 'I'm made of Meccano – don't put any magnets near me!' Morgan is brought to ground by flanker Marcell Coetzee during England's loss to South Africa in November . His self-deprecating humour is part of a philosophical attitude towards the situation he is in. While a home World Cup would be a momentous career highlight, he refuses to agonise about whether his recovery happens fast enough, despite moving heaven and earth to make sure it does. A six-month rehabilitation period would mean Morgan is match-fit by July 10 and wouldn't need to miss any of the training camp which starts just before that red-letter date. But he said: 'If it takes longer, that's just how it is. 'The World Cup is the carrot, but I have to be realistic; if I don't make it, I don't make it. I'm not going to tear myself up about it. I'm doing everything I can to get back for it, but there are certain hurdles I have to clear. I'm quite relaxed about it. I'm pretty sure I'll be back. If I do end up going into the World Cup training camp, I'll be fresh. I'll be blowing out of my a**e, but I'll be fresh!' The recovery programme has conventional elements, with Morgan spending seven weeks in a cast and following up that initial stage with physiotherapy and weight-training at the club. But he is also employing cutting-edge methods to help his leg mend rapidly. Twice a day, four times a week, he spends 90 minutes in a hyperbaric chamber at an MS centre in Gloucester. Morgan makes another powerful ball carry against the Wallabies at Twickenham in November . 'The bulk of what I'm doing is oxygen therapy,' he said. 'I'm being pressurised, to simulate being 10 metres below sea level, and I'm breathing pure oxygen. The thinking is that it increases the red blood cells in your blood, which is brilliant for healing. 'I go in the morning, then go to train with Gloucester, get physio and do upper-body weights, then go back to the oxygen chamber. I'm in there for an hour-and-a-half.' To pass the time, Morgan's creative side is emerging, as he is filling up a large sketch-book with pencil drawings. The subjects are wide-ranging. Billy Vunipola regained the  No 8 jersey in Morgan's absence and has started all three Six Nations games . 'I've drawn a few pictures; my dog, my nephew, a little Mickey Mouse, a turtle, a light-bulb,' he said. 'There's also a little lizard, a Ninja Turtle, an owl… I've just ordered some sketching pencils because it's difficult to get good shading with the ones I've been using. I'm stepping it up! 'I did a couple of bits and pieces at school. It's just a bit of fun, a way of passing the time. I'd be bored out of my brain if I wasn't doing something like the sketching.' Morgan was on a roll before his horror injury. He was named England's Player of the Series after the autumn campaign and had usurped Billy Vunipola to reclaim the No 8 shirt before his barnstorming progress was abruptly halted. In recent weeks, instead of being at the heart of the national team's RBS Six Nations campaign, he has been an observer. He will be at Twickenham next Saturday to watch against and is aiming to spend a day at the team hotel, while maintaining contact with the England coaches. Stuart Lancaster will dearly hope to have Morgan involved at the World Cup and the long-term casualty is confident he will be ready. Veteran Harlequins back rower Nick Easter has been another player to profit from Morgan's absence . He said: 'I feel really positive and, hopefully, that positive attitude will help my healing process. Some people get dragged down with really dark thoughts, but I'm staying upbeat. 'Getting back in time is the hardest battle, but then I have to get selected again, which is going to be a very tough task. Nick Easter has done well since coming back in, Billy is playing well too and I'm missing a block of games. Luckily, I ended on a bit of a high, but I'll have had six months out of rugby. Whether that is a good thing, because I'll be fresh, or will count against me, I don't know, but I'll do everything in my power to be there.' If he makes it, he will have a sketch-book full of souvenirs from his rehabilitation – and a chance to give his mum the ultimate birthday present.", "raw_output": "Ben Morgan fractured his left leg playing for Gloucester in January .\nMorgan is targeting a comeback at the World Cup in September .\nThe Gloucester No 8 is undergoing sessions in a hyperbaric chamber to speed up his recovery .\nMorgan was named England's player of the series following his superb displays during the November Tests .\nBilly Vunipola has reclaimed the England No 8 shirt in Morgan's absence .", "trunc_input": "Once he had come round after emergency surgery, Ben Morgan asked the surgeon two pressing questions; would he ever play again and if so, could he make it back in time for the World Cup? Mercifully for the Gloucester and England No 8 – who had shattered his leg in a match against Saracens the previous night – the answer to both was 'yes'. But that was just the theory; the practice involves relentless determination and dedication, including endless hours in a hyperbaric chamber, where the 26-year-old is mastering the art of sketching while wearing an oxygen mask. No stone is left unturned in Morgan's quest to regain full fitness in time to be part of the national squad for the global gathering in September and October. There are no guarantees he will be ready, but despite the magnitude of his injury, the signs are good and he is infused with optimism. Ben Morgan is undergoing sessions in a hyperbaric chamber to speed up his recovery from a fractured leg . Morgan has been out of action since he injured his leg playing against Saracens in January . Morgan was named England's player of the series following his superb displays during the November Tests .

{"raw_input": "To get in touch with Martin, leave your comments below or send your tweets to @MailSport using #TackleKeown . Sportsmail columnist MARTIN KEOWN answered YOUR questions after an entertaining week in the Champions League and the FA Cup. Chelsea were knocked out by PSG on Wednesday night, with subjects ranging from the referee's performance, Zlatan Ibrahimovic's comments on the Blues being 'babies', David Luiz's return and whether the Premier League is still the best in the world. Also, Arsenal overcame their Old Trafford hoo-doo to beat Manchester United on Monday night, and the former Gunners legend was at the game. But what was that 'money' sign to Arsene Wenger all about? You can read all the answers below. Host commentator . It’s certainly a good way to sum it up. If you think about how you’d react in that situation, he didn’t know whether to laugh or be angry. He probably thought the referee had got it so wrong, and everyone could see it, that he’d get off the hook. The controlled reaction of the Chelsea players was definitely a factor in the red card. Many years ago, when I was playing under George Graham against United, he accused us of being too nice during half-time. He said we had to get around the referee as they were influencing every decision. From that day, I contested every decision, almost giving the referee a running commentary. I would often say, ‘who’s in charge, them or you?’. There’s nothing worse for a referee to hear. I appreciated why people don’t like to see it, but as well as influencing the referee, it makes you fight and compete for everything. It makes you more alive and puts your receptors on red alert. It’s like a game within a game, and believe me, it works. Niall came into the game quite late. As a youngster he did his A-levels and his club Reading helped him through. Just recently he’s turned a huge corner, particularly since Steve Clarke was appointed and started involving him in first-team training. Ireland asked about him last year, but he had an operation, which curtailed his development. Now he’s in the Under 21 squad and we’re very proud. It looks ironic, given that I played for England, but a lot of my family were shocked I didn’t play for Ireland as I come from a big Irish family. I could have played with as much passion for Ireland as I did for England, and it’s Niall’s right to play for Ireland, too. It was a clear demonstration from United that he’s not going to be a part of their future. We know he hasn’t played well, and he looks like he’s lost some sharpness because of his knee injury. Though his last contribution for United, winning a penalty against Sunderland, was very important and has been largely overlooked. He hasn’t played since! I think letting him go is probably the right call though. He’s not sharp enough, and doesn’t strike fear into the opposition. He looks to have given up trying to certain extent. I think Van Gaal is largely responsible for United’s situation at the moment though, not the players. Man management was Sir Alex Ferguson’s forte, and some players find it harder to cope than others. Mangers have to work with players’ minds, bodies and hearts. And when all is not right in their mind they will react to everything. It feels like Van Gaal has created this environment. Fergie would squeeze every ounce out of his players. If he were still there, they wouldn’t be so far away from top of league. I don’t blame either of them, Ben. They were shown the door, so why not? When Roman Abramovich first took over at Chelsea, he offered a lot of money for Thierry Henry, but Arsenal refused and Henry was flattered by it. I think Luiz would have been half-hoping for that same reaction from Chelsea. As for Welbeck, he’s a young man early in his career and was never really given a chance as a centre forward – his preferred role. And then there were the unnecessary comments from Van Gaal, claiming Welbeck was only good enough to be a substitute at United. He wanted to fulfill his dreams at United and he had to listen to that. Now he has the chance to fulfill his dreams with Arsenal. Everyone in the studio thought it was so funny. It’s like showing a montage of Gary [Lineker]'s misses! I was trying to explain that Andy Cole’s run takes me off Giggs’s line so I ended up caught in the middle. My most vivid memory is from after the game when I went into United dressing room to show some respect, but they were in full celebration mode and didn’t show a great deal of respect to us. I felt I had to say something though, it was an epic battle. But they weren’t better than us that day, put it that way... I had to have my smile surgically removed! It was fantastic. I must admit, I was surprised at how many of the young United fans in the ground wanted photos with me and autographs. They were very respectful. I had to walk through the United fans to get to the gantry, and it was a bit intimidating, but overall it was fine. Maybe, because the fans were so young, that hadn’t seen everything that used to go on! There was one occasion when I exclaimed out loud when Arsenal wasted a chance – that got a few comments from the crowd, but it was good to feel like part of my old club again. All credit to Luiz – he has so much self-belief. People were saying Mourinho was a genius for letting him go, but was he a genius last night, Calvin? Of course, he had to let him go for that kind of money. It’s just unfortunate for him that the player came back to demonstrate he was worth every penny. Though I must say, Thiago Silva was magnificent with those successive headers at the other end late on. You couldn’t have written a better script. David Luiz looks like the hero at his old ground, then Silva gives a horror penalty away but snatches the winning goal. It’s a valid argument, Jaymie. However, I think Chelsea’s performance has quite a lot to do with winning the Capital One Cup. I’ve never liked that trophy being awarded so early in season. It’s possible you’ll lose focus, making it tough to keep going. When Chelsea celebrated winning the cup I think they were also enjoying the fact that Manchester City had lost to Liverpool earlier in the day. They were probably thinking they had the league title wrapped up that weekend as well as the League Cup. That looks to have taken the edge off of them. They had a tough game against West Ham afterwards, and they were very lucky to get a result there. They look to have the wrong mentality. Money sign? We were talking about the grass! The Old Trafford pitch is part synthetic, part grass, which was a change sanctioned by David Moyes last season. We were remarking on how it compares to a normal grass pitch. I don’t think it makes it any less interesting, Nico, but whether it’s the best? I’m not even sure I thought it was best when Chelsea and Manchester United were in the Champions League final in 2008. Before Christmas, it looked like Chelsea and Real Madrid could win it. Suddenly there are huge question marks. It’s all about finding consistency and form at right time. The workload doesn’t help, but Chelsea had seven days to prepare. Routine is everything for footballers, and perhaps going from a game every three days to one a week might have affected them. Usually Chelsea control the tempo. They tried to press, but the likes of Thiago Motta and Marco Verratti were so calm and technically gifted... this forced the Chelsea players to sit off a bit as they couldn’t get the ball off them. PSG didn’t panic with ten men, they were brave and kept the ball in tight situations. They just ignored the fact they had 10 men, it was an incredible show of strength. It was like they had been hypnotised into thinking they had 11 men! Jose Mourinho was just as guilty as his team. Usually he’s very decisive – sending on three subs if he needs to – and gets it spot on. But he had them time wasting after they scored the first goal. They didn’t go out to win the match. Ibrahimovic goes to ground, realises he could make heavy contact and tries to pull away - I agree. Oscar knows exactly what he’s doing by feigning injury – it’s not nearly as bad as he makes out. I don’t think he should have been sent off, I’m not even sure it was a booking. The speed at which the Chelsea players all surround the referee is important – it’s the quickest you’ll ever see John Terry run! They can’t even be certain what’s happened or if their player is injured, but it doesn’t stop at least five or six of them waving their arms in air. It’s a calculated, orchestrated reaction, and they’ve been doing it for a while.", "raw_output": "Chelsea knocked out of Champions League after away goals defeat by PSG .\nChelsea surrounding the referee: It's a calculated, orchestrated reaction, and they've been doing it for a while It's the quickest you'll ever see John Terry run!\nIt was like PSG had been hypnotised into thinking they had 11 men .\nChelsea didn't go out to win the match .\nPremier League the best?

{"raw_input": "Glenn McGrath has repeated a familiar rallying call by predicting Australia will inflict a 5-0 Ashes whitewash on England this summer. The former pace attack leader of Australia's all-conquering Test team in the early 2000s has habitually forecast thrashings for England in the past, and has been embarrassed when Australia have not performed as he expected, notably in the 2005 series. He played a part in Australia triumphing 5-0 Down Under in 2006-07, and again envisaged the same result in England in 2009, only for Andrew Strauss to lead the home side to their triumph.

Peter Moores' side have suffered a terrible World Cup but will hope to bounce back in Test cricket . McGrath had more recently refrained from trumpeting Australia as unbeatable by England, even prior to their 5-0 demolition job in 2013-14, but that is how he again positions Michael Clarke's Test team. With England toiling to sorry effect at the World Cup, McGrath is looking to the summer and sees more misery on the cards when ousted limited-overs skipper Alastair Cook returns to take the helm of the five-day team. He told BBC Sport: 'If the Australian team keeps playing as they are, they're going to go to England full of confidence. England were knocked out of the World Cup by Bangladesh last week, and McGrath can't see them improving . During his playing days McGrath made a habit of predicting whitewashes, and was not always proved right . 'I can't see England beating them and I'm more than happy to predict 5-0.' McGrath, 45, expects the World Cup debacle to be followed by change in the England camp.

{"raw_input": "Vienna’s famous palaces and opera houses are set to be joined by a new tourist attraction – the tallest wooden skyscraper in the world. When it is completed in 2017, the timber-framed tower will be 24 storeys high with more than 200,000 square feet of commercial and residential space. Designed by architects at RLP Rudiger Lainer+Partner, the €65million (£45million) HoHo Vienna project is expected to include a hotel, offices, flats and wellness centre. When it is completed in 2017, about 75 per cent of the 24-storey tower will be made from wood . It will be located in Seestadt Aspern, a massive urban development site in north-east Vienna, about 75 per cent of the building will be made of wood. The 275-ft tower will be a hybrid: it will have a concrete core with a self-supporting timber shell secured to it. Inside, flats will have exposed wood ceilings, columns and walls to create a natural atmosphere, according to renderings released by the design firm. Wood was chosen because the popular building material in Austria is affordable, high in quality and environmentally friendly. Inside, the flats will feature exposed wood ceilings, columns and walls to create a natural atmosphere . With three-quarters of the building made of wood, it is expected to save 2,800 tonnes of CO2 emissions. But the plans have sparked concerns from local fire officials as the developers, cetus Baudevelopment Gmbh, prepare to begin construction this autumn. Vienna fire service spokesman Christian Wegner told the Guardian: ‘The main factor is that everyone wants to build higher and higher buildings. ‘An 84-metre-high building in Europe is not usual and there are a lot of necessities that have to be realised. ‘A few of us were upset because it was crazy to present an idea like this that has not been discussed with everyone yet.’ Forte in Melbourne, Australia is currently the tallest timber-framed residential building in the world . He said special tests must be conducted on the hybrid model and a fail-safe sprinkler system. The architects said: ‘The timber construction system provides high efficiency in terms of thermal insulation and serviceability. ‘Wood composite floors are secured to the central concrete supporting cores, and extend out to the building edge. ‘These floor panels are supported by a wooden column system around the outline of the building. This structure then supports pre-fabricated external wall modules that combine solid wood panels with an “earthy” concrete shell to form the building's facade.’ When it opens in approximately two years HoHo Vienna will be nearly three times as tall as a current record holder.

{"raw_input": "A woman who tried to sue her landlord after she fell off an upstairs landing and was left paraplegic has had her case dismissed because a judge found she was 'severely intoxicated' when she fell. Jane Hutch was having a celebratory drink at her rented townhouse in Doubleview, Perth, with her adult son and daughter on Christmas Day in 2009 after signing a lease on the property the previous day. Ms Hutch went upstairs at the two-storey property to find her bag, and when she could not see it in her bedroom she had a 'quick look' over the balustrade of a landing at the top of the stairs to see if it was in the kitchen below. She lost her balance and fell over the balustrade, falling several metres onto the floor below. Ms Hutch suffered head and spinal injuries and is now a paraplegic. Jane Hutch tried to sue her landlord after she fell off an upstairs landing and was left paraplegic . She sued her landlord Christopher Geoffrey Ryan for damages in the District Court of Western Australia, claiming that the balustrade was too low and she was therefore unable to stop herself once she had begun to fall. But Judge Felicity Davis ruled that the accident was caused by Ms Hutch's 'severe intoxication' and Mr Ryan was therefore not liable for damages. Ms Hutch gave evidence that she and her son started drinking sparkling wine at 10.30am on December 25, and said she 'probably' drank a bottle or the equivalent of 6.5 standard drinks. The accident occurred just before 1.30pm and she was taken to hospital by ambulance. Tests at hospital found she had a blood alcohol level about six times the legal driving limit. Toxicologist Professor David Joyce gave evidence that Ms Hutch's blood alcohol level suggested she had drunk between 20 and 21 standard drinks. Judge Felicity Davis ruled that the accident was caused by Ms Hutch's 'severe intoxication' and her landlord was therefore not liable for damages . 'Based on her plasma and blood alcohol level and Professor Joyce's evidence, I find that the plaintiff was severely intoxicated and that this influenced her behaviour when it came to matters of safety,' Judge Davis said. 'I find on the balance of probabilities that the reason the plaintiff leaned beyond the point of no return was because of her state of intoxication.' Judge Davis also found that the balustrade measured 865mm and was compliant with building codes, despite Ms Hutch's expert witnesses submitting evidence suggesting it only measured 857mm. The judge said the landlord's expert witness, builder and building surveyor Darren Mouchmore, 'properly measured' the balustrade and found it to be 865mm.", "raw_output": "Jane Hutch, from Perth, fell off an upstairs landing  and was left paraplegic .\nShe was having a celebratory drink with her children on Christmas Day .\nMs Hutch sued her landlord, claiming the balustrade was too low .\nBut a judge found the accident was caused by Ms Hutch's 'severe intoxication', as she had consumed between 20 and 21 standard drinks .", "trunc_input": "A woman who tried to sue her landlord after she fell off an upstairs landing and was left paraplegic has had her case dismissed because a judge found she was 'severely intoxicated' when she fell.

'This follows a scan on an injury that he sustained during Liverpool's game against Manchester United on Sunday. 'The England medical team took the decision on Monday evening having assessed Daniel following the squad's arrival at St. George's Park on Monday afternoon.' For Sturridge it is the latest in a sequence of fitness issues this season. He was Hodgson's first-choice centre-forward at the World Cup last summer but missed five months of this season after pulling a thigh muscle during an England training session in September. There was a blaze of controversy about whether he should have been resting or training on that particular day, followed by complications in his recovery process, none of which helped the relationship between club and country. Sturridge then suffered with calf muscle injuries and was just getting back to his sharpest form when he hobbled out of Anfield with a stiff hip after scoring Liverpool's goal in a 2-1 defeat against Manchester United.

Sturridge and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, however, will be wary of taking risks after a campaign already ruined by injuries and with the Anfield club locked in a fight for a top-four finish. Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck are available for Hodgson but Sturridge's exit boost Kane's chances of making his senior debut against Lithuania on Friday. There may also be the chance of a call-up for QPR's Charlie Austin, or promotion from the Under 21s for Burnley's Danny Ings. Kane, 21, is in the midst of a remarkable season and took his goal tally to 29 with a hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday, but a club-v-country issue is brewing around him because England want him for the European U21 Championships, in June, while Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino thinks he needs a month of complete rest at the end of the season. England are set to train at Tottenham on Thursday and Pochettino plans to be on site.

{"raw_input": "Johnny Herbert believes McLaren could find themselves at the back end of the grid when the new Formula One season gets under way. The Woking-based marque have struggled to put in the pre-season testing miles due to a number of issues with their new car - with Honda returning to the sport and providing their first attempt at a current F1 power unit. With other teams pounding around Jerez and Barcelona collecting valuable data and information ahead of the season opener in Melbourne on March 15, McLaren have often found their car back in the garage with one fault or another. The McLaren car could struggle at the start of the season, reckons Johnny Herbert . Herbert fears for McLaren . Add to that the fact two-time world champion Fernando Alonso will not be racing in Australia after crashing out at high-speed in Barcelona and it has not been the best reunion for McLaren and Honda - with Herbert tipping them to really struggle in the opening rounds. 'There is definitely a chance of that,' Herbert said when asked if the eight-time constructors' champions could find themselves behind a host of other teams this year. 'So many cars have improved. The middle of the pack seems very close. Lotus seem better, Sauber look better. Ferrari look faster than they were last year as well - Red Bull and Toro Rosso, also. 'The middle pack is tight but we haven't seen the McLaren setting their best times so we don't know where they will be. 'The run of over 100 laps (from Button in Barcelona) put them in the middle of that pack - is that a true showing of their pace? We really don't know. 'We don't know the whole grid order because I don't think everyone has shown their full hand and, unfortunately for McLaren and everyone else, I don't think Mercedes have either.' With the news that Alonso, re-signed to the team after the Spaniard left Ferrari, will be sitting out of the curtain-raiser after his mysterious crash has only added to McLaren's issues - with Herbert questioning why the rekindled relationship with Honda has got off to such an underwhelming start. 'McLaren have been a disappointment so far,' the former Benetton and Stewart driver told the Press Association. Fernando Alonso will miss the curtain-raiser in Australia after his horrific crash in Barcelona . 'You were thinking \"Honda have come back and are back with McLaren again. They had all the success in the late 80s and they had last year to look and see what was going on - they saw other manufacturers having to overcome issues whilst they were working on their engine. 'All of these issues they have had have made it really difficult for them to get any serious running whatsoever. They have had a mass of problems that haven't helped them. 'It is sad news that Fernando will not be in Australia - everything has gone against them so far. 'The preparation is something that maybe wasn't to the high standards than Ron Dennis is always after. 'This is something that should have been ready, the new Honda relationship and moving it forward with Jenson and Fernando.

{"raw_input": "Her salacious blog about her time as a high-class call-girl formed the basis of the money-spinning Belle de Jour books, and was sensationally challenged in a legal case brought by her ex-boyfriend who said she had never worked as an escort. But now author Brooke Magnanti has released a photograph of herself dressed in racy lingerie and posing seductively, saying it will form the basis of an extraordinary court case in which she will aim to prove she worked as a prostitute. Former lover Owen Morris – known only as The Boy in the books – is suing Dr Magnanti for defamation and breach of privacy, claiming her books destroyed his RAF career and saying he does not believe she worked as a call girl. Scroll down for video . The picture and advert Brooke Magnanti says will prove she worked as a call girl after her former lover said claims she was a prostitute were false . But this week it emerged that Dr Magnanti, 39, is to counter-sue for libel, and is likely to use the photo from the archived page of an escort website Alphababes from October 2003 as evidence of her work as a prostitute. The advert gives her name as Taro – a reference to a restaurant mentioned in her book – and states: 'Check out the pictures of our new addition, a super intelligent petite blonde Taro who is currently studying for her PhD and can provide all the services.' Dr Magnanti – whose books spawned the TV drama Secret Diary Of A Call Girl starring Billie Piper – also has photos of what she claims are bank statements showing payments made by alleged clients of £240 and £260 in October 2003. In 2013, The Mail on Sunday revealed Mr Morris was suing the author, claiming she could not have been a prostitute while they were in a relationship because she was typically clad in 'cute second-hand jumpers' rather than sexy outfits. Dr Magnanti, 39, is to counter-sue for libel, and is likely to use the photo from the archived page of an escort website Alphababes from October 2003 as evidence of her work as a prostitute which gives her name as Taro . Her salacious blog about her time as a high-class call-girl formed the basis of the money-spinning Belle de Jour books . The books about Dr Magnanti's life were later turned into an ITV2 series Secret Diary of a Call Girl starring Billie Piper (right) But Dr Magnanti has hit back with photographs of her wearing a silk red top and a photo of her at Henley Regatta wearing an Austin Reed jacket and a bracelet bought for her by a client. She claims to have an appointment book detailing her clients, as well as Mr Morris's diary in which he allegedly writes about his shock of finding out about her work in the sex trade. On her Belle de Jour blog she has outlined her case, saying Mr Morris's claims were an attack on her integrity. 'When the case goes to trial, I will have to present evidence that I was a sex worker. Starting with this – an archive.org snap of my first escorting ad from October 2003. Readers of the first book may recall this was the session with the grumpy photographer I wrote about. As I have often said, it was that experience – being made to wear terrible lingerie, awkward poses, all the rest – that first made me think, 'Hey, I should be blogging this.' ' In Secret Diary Of A Call Girl, Billie Piper plays Belle, an upmarket London call girl who keeps her profession secret from her family . The couple met in Sheffield in 2001, while Dr Magnanti was studying for her PhD in forensic science. She began writing anonymously as Belle de Jour in 2003 and, in November 2009, outed herself in a newspaper interview. The couple had split earlier that year. In August 2013, The Mail on Sunday revealed Mr Morris would be suing Dr Magnanti. He said: 'The Belle de Jour myth has ruined me and rendered me unemployable. The private lives of me, my family and friends were not only used without my knowledge or consent, but twisted and darkened. I am suing her because I want to stop Brooke destroying my life further.' In a statement, Dr Magnanti said: 'I can confirm a counter-claim has been lodged. 'I have been advised by my QC to offer no further comment pending the resolution of this litigation.' If the case goes ahead, it is believed it will be the first time a woman has sued for defamation for suggestions she was not a prostitute. Last night, Mr Morris did not respond to requests for comment. The case against Dr Magnanti is set to be heard in June. Dr Magnanti's story was sensationally challenged in a legal case brought by her ex-boyfriend who said she had never worked as an escort but another lover has backed her claim . Rowing coach Nick Wilde, 45, is known in the books as main character ‘N’, one of Belle’s best friends and former partners. He confirmed Dr Magnanti told him she was a prostitute – but said details of her books were exaggerated or deliberately altered to protect individuals she knew. ‘I have read the books and I’m familiar with N, who is based on me,’ he said. ‘I know N is an amalgam of characters and that there are things the character said that I never said and events he attended that I was at. 'There are also things I said and places where I was that are attributed to other people.’ He said that Brooke did confess to him that she was a prostitute and he is astonished at the suggestion that she was not. ‘She told me she was a prostitute and I believe that,’ Nick says. ‘Of course, I have no proof one way or another, because obviously I wasn’t there when she did it and I never lived with her. 'But she didn’t throw money around, not that I could see – she wasn’t exactly turning up at the pub in a Bentley.’ Nick, who has had no contact with Brooke for six years, said he believes the books are fiction with  a basis in reality. ‘Characters in the book are based on people. There is truth in it, but where the line is of who is real, who is not, I can’t tell you.

{"raw_input": "Rating: . This is going to be special, I tell myself as we pass medieval Penshurst Place, lit up to dramatic effect, with the pretty village church glowing next to it. Certainly, the Leicester Arms Hotel, near Tunbridge Wells, had looked cheering on the website - a village pub given a good wash and brush up without losing its charm. Not quite. Not much good for a weekend of any sort: The Leicester Arms is in tired and in real need of a makeover . The whole place seems in the grip of a collective lethargy. I'm not even given much in the way of a welcome. 'Don't worry, this isn't rubbish,' says the weary young woman who shows me to a room on the first floor above the kitchen extractor - even though only two other people are staying. She is not referring to the room, but to the eight bulging black plastic bin bags - 'it's just sheets and stuff.' You might think sheets and stuff could be stored elsewhere. But then, on seeing my drab room, I have my doubts. It's a charmless affair. The window frame has been painted recently, but no one has bothered to scrape off the drips stuck to the panes; three dull watercolours hang on the walls; the small desk is battered and bruised; and the bedside lights are those infuriating ones that only come on when you tap them. Even the laminated card telling you how to get an outside line is creased and uninviting. Things are more convivial downstairs. The panelled bar, with its saddles on the walls, open fires (not lit) and exposed timber beams provide some atmosphere, but the best part is the dining room up a short flight of stairs, with its mish-mash of tables and chairs, some of which are lovely antique jobs. A mere three tables are occupied, but the wait between my indifferent first course (two tiny bits of rolled-up smoked salmon and some avocado mousse) and my main course (sea bass in an overly rich sauce with gnocchi) is unforgivable. 'Any veg?' I ask. 'Kale, that's about it,' says the waitress in a wouldn't-bother sort of way. 'I'll have some kale, then, please.' It's a Wednesday night, but feels like the butt end of a Sunday. I almost long for someone to ask if 'everything's all right with your meal' if only because it would mean I can ask for another glass of wine. I get talking in the morning to the 'sheets and stuff' member of staff, and I like her no-nonsense honesty. 'Been busy?' I ask. 'Not really, bit dead actually.' 'Who comes here at this time of year?' 'We get a lot down for a dirty weekend.' Perhaps if you're down for a dirty weekend you can forgive certain flaws. But calling this old boozer a hotel is a liberty too far. The Leicester Arms Hotel .

A baby girl born in India with a 'trunk-like' protrusion between her eyes is being worshipped by locals . The baby girl, who has yet to be named, was born Thursday in a village in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh . 'My sister-in-law gave birth to a girl at 7:00 a.m. and her face looks exactly like Lord Ganesha. Everybody is saying she is an incarnation of the God,' the baby's aunt Rajani told ANI. 'This is why whoever hears about her is coming here to get a glimpse of the baby and are making whatever offerings possible.' The girl comes from a poor family with her father, a vegetable vendor who earns 250 rupee ($5.17) per day, hoping his daughter's birth will bring the family better luck, the Times of India reported. She has three healthy older siblings and lives in a small house in the northern Indian village. Doctors said the girl's protrusion was most likely due to a gene mutation, caused by malnutrition and pollution.

{"raw_input": "(CNN)As the U.S. and several Eastern European NATO countries conduct a series of military exercises near Russia's border, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his Northern Fleet \"to full alert in a snap combat readiness exercise\" in the Arctic, state-run media reported Monday. At least one Russian leader described the drill as routine and unrelated to the \"international situation.\" The fleet got its orders at 8 a.m. Monday, according to Sputnik, launching a land, sea and air drill that will involve 38,000 troops, 41 ships, 15 submarines and 110 aircraft. \"The main task of the (combat readiness drill) is to assess the armed forces from the Northern Fleet's capabilities in fulfilling tasks in providing military security of the Russian Federation in the Arctic region,\" Russian Defense Minister Gen. Sergey Shoigu told the media outlet. \"New challenges and threats of military security demand the further heightening of military capabilities of the armed forces and special attention will be paid to the state of the newly formed strategic merging (of forces) in the North.\" The drills will run through Friday, Sputnik reported. A flotilla of minesweepers will support the Northern Fleet's nuclear submarines in the Barents Sea as part of the drill, the Tass news agency reported, citing a Defense Ministry statement. \"Mine-sweeping groups of the Kola Flotilla have moved to the designated areas of the Barents within the framework of a snap check of combat readiness of the Northern Fleet forces for supporting the deployment of the main forces of the fleet, including the deployment of nuclear and diesel submarines of the Northern Fleet,\" the statement says. The ships will conduct magnetic, acoustic and contact demining sweeps during the drill, Tass reported. Despite a number of countries participating in various military drills in Eastern Europe, a Kremlin spokesman described the Northern Fleet inspection as routine practice aimed at improving military capabilities. \"The practice of snap checks will become regular, as it is beneficial for improving the mechanisms of control and operation of the armed forces. This is an absolutely regular process of the armed forces' operation, of preparation and development of Russia's armed forces,\" Dmitry Peskov told Tass on Monday. Conversely, a diplomat told Tass that Russia was \"deeply concerned\" about NATO drills near its border. \"It is especially surprising that this is happening in Northeastern Europe, which is the most stable region not only on our continent, but also maybe in the whole world,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexey Meshkov said. \"Such NATO actions lead to destabilization of the situation and increasing tensions in Northeastern Europe.\" Among the recent drills in Eastern Europe: . • In its largest military operation in decades, Norway sent 5,000 troops to conduct military exercises between Alta and Lakselv in Finnmark county, which borders Russia, according to the Barents Observer. • About 100 U.S. soldiers are expected to conduct an exercise this month using a Patriot missile battery and a Polish air defense brigade \"at a location on Polish territory,\" Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said. The exercise is part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, which began in response to Russia's involvement in Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea last year, the U.S. Defense Department said. • Also as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, the U.S. Army will soon send armored Stryker vehicles on a 1,100-mile convoy through six European countries to show solidarity with its allies. The \"highly visible\" convoy will travel through Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Latvia and the Czech Republic en route to Vilseck, Germany, a U.S. Army Europe spokesman told the military newspaper, Stars and Stripes. • In a \"regularly scheduled\" exercise aimed at demonstrating NATO's commitment to \"collective defense\" in the Black Sea, the Standing NATO Maritime Group Two -- a collection of warships -- will train with the Bulgarian, Romanian and Turkish navies and visit Varna, Bulgaria, to meet with local authorities and navy officials, NATO said. • The U.S. Air Force moved a dozen A-10 Thunderbolt \"tankbuster\" attack jets to an air base in Germany and the U.S. military placed hundreds of tanks and military vehicles in Latvia, where they'll be matched up with 3,000 troops from Fort Stewart, Georgia.

The goalkeeper was outstanding as City were beaten 3-1 on aggregate in the Champions League last-16, with only his string of saves over the two legs preventing Pellegrini's side from an even more embarrassing result. Hart was dropped by the Chilean following a poor run of form last season, but returned soon afterwards as Manchester City went on to win the Premier League title and the Capital One Cup. Joe Hart chats to David James for a special BT Sport interview set to air at 6.30pm on Friday night . The England goalkeeper was speaking to James during ‘David James meets Joe Hart’ Hart said that Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has his full backing despite a disappointing season . This season has been less straightforward so far, but Hart, speaking to David James during David James meets Joe Hart in a special programme which airs on BT Sport 1 at 6.30pm on Friday, is adamant the under-fire manager retains his total respect. 'It was bad because I never wanted to come out the team, but I had to - the manager made his decision,' said Hart. 'I thought he was fantastic with me how he was. 'As a manager, I totally respect his authority. He had a decision to make, he didn’t just flip a board and suddenly you’re not playing. 'I just wanted to use the time for the best, and when I did come in, I wanted it to feel natural. I just wanted to slot in. I didn’t want to come in and make a million saves. I didn’t want to come in and change a game. I just wanted to slot back in, that’s the way it should be, and carry on.'

For the second time, Manchester City have  struggled in the Premier League following a title-winning campaign, and Hart admits  his side haven't been good enough this year. 'We’ve definitely got the capabilities and we’ve got the team,' he continued. 'But that’s only half the battle in this league. It doesn’t matter how good you are, or how good you think you are. It’s what you do on the day and you can lose against anyone. 'I’ve only had two (titles) to defend. I can only speak from that experience and the first one we did find hard because we’d built on everything to get it. 'I think we would openly admit that the season afterwards we expected that we would do it, that we had cracked it and that we were going to be that team. 'But we weren’t. We had to fight tooth and nail. We had to change managers. We had to change players. We had to come against all odds to win the league again last season. So I think we are all well aware of how hard it is to win the league in the first place, let alone back to back. 'But like I say, with the team and set up that we’ve got, we’ve got everything in the right places. That said, to do it is another thing and at the moment it is proving difficult.

{"raw_input": "It was just over two months ago that McDonald's released an advertisement stating it 'will never be kale'. But it seems the fast food giant may be having a change of heart regarding the trendy super food, with a new report suggesting that McDonald's plans to introduce kale to its menu soon. Janney Capital Markets restaurant analysts wrote that 'one of our industry sources indicates that McDonald's U.S. plans to roll out kale as an ingredient in its restaurants at some point in the not-too-distant future.' Scroll down for video . McHipster? Despite running this ad just weeks ago, it's been reported that McDonald's will begin to offer kale on its menu in the near future . Janney analyst Mark Kalinowski told CNN the move could mean kale salads and even smoothies may be on the horizon and said the company's goal is to appear healthier or of a higher quality. 'McDonald's clearly aims to raise consumers' perception of the quality of its food. Adding kale to the menu in some way could help be a step in this direction,' he wrote. However, McDonald's stayed mum when questioned about the superfood, telling CNN, in part: 'we're always looking at new and different ingredients.' Either way, don't expect your future Big Macs to be piled with the curly greens. Six weeks ago, the fast food mega chain debuted a commercial in which the words 'WILL NEVER BE KALE' appeared in block letters over the signature burger's lettuce layer. The news comes after McDonald's on Monday vowed to remake itself as a 'modern, progressive burger company' after aggressive competition from Chipotle, Chick-fil-A and myriad 'better burger' chains bit into U.S. restaurant sales last month. February ended the run of former Chief Executive Don Thompson. His short tenure included 2014, when falling profit, revenue and traffic resulted in one of McDonald's worst years in decades. Steve Easterbrook, a McDonald's insider who led two UK-based restaurant chains before returning to the company in 2013, took the helm at the Golden Arches on March 1. Leafy: The trendy vegetable would likely be offered in the form of salads and smoothies, say analysts . Moving on up: Reports of the new McMenu item come just after the company's announced intention Monday to become a more 'modern, progressive burger company' The company that virtually invented fast food has struggled to find the right recipe to meet diners' growing appetite for healthier, fresher food. In his first big move as CEO, Easterbrook last week announced that McDonald's USA will switch to chicken raised with fewer antibiotics. The policy, which will affect McNuggets and other products sold in its roughly 14,000 U.S. stores, will put McDonald's more in step with Chipotle and Chick-fil-A. McDonald's shares were up 0.8 percent at $97.90 at midday. The stock is up about 10 percent since Easterbrook's promotion was announced in late January. Sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months dropped a steeper-than-expected 4 percent in February, contributing to the 1.7 percent decline in global sales for the month. Analysts, on average, had expected a 0.7 percent fall for the United States and a 0.3 percent drop worldwide, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. February sales results from Europe were slightly better than expected, but the unit that includes Asia continued to struggle with the after-effects of a supply chain scandal last year. McDonald's has been trimming complicated menus to speed up service; giving restaurant operators more control over aspects including regional food choices; testing customized burgers and sandwiches to compete with Chipotle, Subway and other popular restaurants; and tweaking advertising to emphasize 'Lovin,' a play on the company's ubiquitous 'I'm lovin' it' tagline. Still, one pension fund adviser on Monday renewed its call for McDonald's to shake up its board. 'Today's disappointing numbers underscore the widespread reforms McDonald's requires ... and these changes must go beyond new management to include refreshing its stale and insular board,' said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of the CtW Investment Group, which advises union pension funds that hold a small percentage of McDonald's shares.", "raw_output": "A Big Mac ad that debuted in January pasted the words 'will never be kale' over the signature burger's lettuce .\nNow industry insiders say the company will turn heel in an effort to culture a healthier, fresher image .\nAnalysts predict the vegetable will likely appear in the form of salads or smoothies .", "trunc_input": "It was just over two months ago that McDonald's released an advertisement stating it 'will never be kale'.

{"raw_input": "London (CNN)At the time it probably seemed like fun: Jeremy Clarkson and a crew from the top-rated BBC TV show Top Gear driving a Porsche in Argentina. The only problem was that the car's registration plate, H982 FLK, appeared to refer to the 1982 Falklands War between the UK and Argentina, fought over a remote British colony off the coast of Patagonia, which both countries claim. The conflict, which claimed the lives of 655 Argentinian servicemen and 255 Britons, ended with a British victory. Clarkson and the rest of the production team were in the country filming a TV special on a remote highway that passes through Chile and Argentina, and the number plate sparked anger among locals over the perennially touchy subject of the war. As the crew attempted to flee by road to Chile, they were attacked by an angry crowd who hurled rocks and bricks at the Porsche and other cars in the convoy. Clarkson, who fronts Top Gear, later said an angry mob tried to attack them with pickax handles and shouted \"burn their cars.\" \"This was not some jolly jape that went awry. For once, we did nothing wrong,\" he told The Sun. Top Gear producers said the numbers and letters on the registration plates had not been chosen deliberately. The motoring show, fronted by Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, has made a name for itself globally with risky stunts and a brand of blokish humor that often treads the line and regularly steps over it. Clarkson is determinedly anti-politically correct among the topics he rails about, both on the show and in his newspaper and magazine columns. Favored topics include environmentalism, traffic laws and liberals. The latest \"fracas\" has seen Clarkson suspended by the BBC, which broadcasts Top Gear, for allegedly hitting a producer. The presenter, who is one of the BBC's highest earners, has previously caused offense during shoots in foreign countries and regularly court controversy at home. In July 2014, Clarkson came under fire for a racist comment made during a Top Gear special in Myanmar. The slur came during a show segment which showed hosts Clarkson, Hammond and May looking at a bridge they had built over the River Kwai as a local man walked over it. \"That is a proud moment. But there's a slope on it,\" Clarkson said. \"You're right,\" co-star Hammond replied. \"It's definitely higher on that side.\" Following complaints, the UK's media watchdog, Ofcom, said the use of the word \"slope,\" which is a derogatory term, was offensive and that the episode broke broadcasting rules. The show's executive producer Andy Wilman said in a statement, that they \"[regretted] any offense caused,\" adding, \"when we used the word 'slope' ... it was a light-hearted word play joke referencing both the build quality of the bridge and the local Asian man who was crossing it.\" Over the years, Clarkson has been in trouble for an apparent series of racist comments including characterizing Mexicans as \"lazy and feckless\" and saying that everyone who traveled to India got \"the trots.\" He was also accused of using the \"n-word\" while filming the motoring show by UK newspaper The Mirror. \"Eeny, meeny, miny moe ...,\" he sang in video footage published by The Mirror, \"Catch a nigger by his toe.\" Initially, Clarkson vehemently denied the accusation on Twitter but following public condemnation and calls for the BBC to fire him, he begged viewers for forgiveness in a video statement posted online. \"I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure. I was mortified by this, horrified. It is a word I loathe,\" Clarkson said. Among the condemnations was a sternly worded statement from 10 Downing Street, the office UK Prime Minister David Cameron -- a friend of Clarkson's -- saying he would \"certainly not\" use the n-word. According to the BBC, the PM's spokesperson added that he felt it was \"absolutely right that there has been an apology.\" Both Clarkson and the UK prime minister have homes in an affluent, rural part of central England known as the Cotswolds. They are part of a wealthy group of media, politics and showbiz acquaintances who live in and around Cameron's Oxfordshire constituency. They have been dubbed \"The Chipping Norton Set.\" Among them is former News International CEO and editor of The Sun and The News of the World, Rebekah Brooks, who came to prominence during the News International phone hacking scandal, for which she was acquitted. They also include former Blur musician Alex James and Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch. In an article for the Daily Telegraph, former chief political commentator Peter Oborne described \"The Chipping Norton Set\" as \"an incestuous collection of louche, affluent, power-hungry and amoral Londoners.\" Clarkson's popularity also comes from regular columns in venerated newspaper, The Sunday Times and tabloid The Sun. A recent Sunday Times column with the headline \"Phrasebook, tick. Local currency, tick. Tracksuit, tick. I'm off to the north\" attracted the ire of people from the northern English city of Liverpool. He wrote: \"People up there (north) earn less, die more quickly, have fewer jobs and live in houses that are worth the square root of sod all.\" Local newspaper, The Liverpool Echo, which pointed out that Clarkson is a northerner himself, published a series of responses to the piece from local people who described him as \"stuck in the past\" and \"a fake southerner\" whose comments were \"as dated as his double denims.\"", "raw_output": "Top Gear's Jeremy Clarkson is determinedly anti-PC; courts controversy .\nBroadcaster has caused offense for racist remarks in the past .\nFriends with UK PM David Cameron and former news head Rebekah Brooks .", "trunc_input": "London (CNN)At the time it probably seemed like fun: Jeremy Clarkson and a crew from the top-rated BBC TV show Top Gear driving a Porsche in Argentina.

{"raw_input": "House prices are up 5.1 per cent on a year ago, a report has revealed - but growth is still slowing and some areas are even in decline. Average UK property values in March reached £189,454 in March compared to £187,964 in February 2014, according to Nationwide Building Society. But the annual pace of house price growth has been slowing for seven months in a row, and has reached less than half the rate of growth seen for much of last summer, when the year-on-year increase was in double digits. A report has revealed house prices are up 5.1 per cent across Britain - but growth has been slowing for seven months in a row . Last June, prices were climbing at a rate of 11.8 per cent year-on-year. On a month-on-month basis, house prices edged up by 0.1 per cent in March, following a 0.1 per cent decrease in February. Nationwide said that all regions except the North of England have seen a further slowing in the annual pace of house price growth during the first three months of this year. London remains the strongest-performing region, with average prices up by 12.7 per cent year on year, taking them to £408,780 on average. But the pace of price growth in the capital has slowed sharply compared with the end of 2014, when the pace of annual growth was 17.8 per cent. Wales remains the weakest area in the UK for annual house price growth. At £139,171 on average, prices in Wales are down by 0.5 per cent year on year. Despite seeing a rise in the average cost of a house, the pace of price growth in London has slowed sharply compared with the end of 2014 . St Albans (pictured) in Hertfordshire was named as the UK's top performing city for house prices over the last year, with average values up by 22 per cent to reach £498,957 . Average UK property values in March reached £189,454 in March compared to £187,964 in February 2014 . Wales is the only UK nation or region where prices have fallen year on year in the first quarter of 2015. St Albans in Hertfordshire was named as the UK's top performing city for house prices over the last year, with average values up by 22 per cent to reach £498,957. Manchester was named as the weakest performing city, with values down by 1 per cent year on year, taking them to £211,571. Reading, Oxford, London and Brighton were among the UK's other top price performers over the last year, while Bradford, Plymouth, Leicester and Cardiff were among the weakest. In Scotland, house prices have increased by 1.3 per cent year on year, taking them to £140,180 on average, and in Northern Ireland they have increased by 5.7 per cent, pushing them to £121,052 typically. The North of England has bucked the general trend seen across the UK, seeing the annual pace of price growth accelerate from 4.4 per cent at the end of last year to 4.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2015. The average house price in the North of England is £125,299. On the market: London remains the strongest-performing region, with average prices up by 12.7 per cent year on year, taking them to £408,780 on average . Yorkshire and Humberside was the weakest performing region in England, with prices up by 1.3 per cent over the last year, pushing prices there to £141,647 typically. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that, across the UK, average house prices are currently around 2 per cent above the levels seen before the financial crisis. He said: 'Economic conditions have remained supportive, with labour market conditions continuing to improve and mortgage interest rates close to all-time lows. 'Nevertheless, the pace of housing market activity has remained subdued, with the number of mortgages approved for house purchase in January around 20 per cent below the level prevailing one year ago.' Some experts have suggested that the looming general election could have an impact on the housing market, with people putting off their plans to await the outcome. The annual pace of house price growth has been slowing for seven months in a row, and has reached less than half the rate of growth seen for much of last summer . But a report from the British Bankers' Association (BBA) found this week that the number of mortgage approvals being made to home-buyers is starting to see an upward trend. The BBA said that early 2015 is seeing a higher demand for mortgages than the levels seen towards the end of last year. The reform of stamp duty in December has made the tax cheaper for the majority of home-buyers who are liable to pay it. Meanwhile, estate agents have reported receiving inquiries from older people who are considering investing in the buy-to-let market, due to the new pension freedoms which will come into force in April and give people aged 55 and over a greater level of choice over how they use their pension pots. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist for IHS Global Insight, said: 'There are signs that housing market activity may now be slowly turning around after weakening during much of 2014 and we suspect it will gradually improve over the coming months.'", "raw_output": "Average UK property values in March reached £189,454, Nationwide reveals .\nAnnual pace of house price growth slowing for the seventh month in a row .\nLondon remains strongest performing region with prices up 12.7 per cent .\nWales is the weakest performing with house prices at £139,171 on average .", "trunc_input": "House prices are up 5.1 per cent on a year ago, a report has revealed - but growth is still slowing and some areas are even in decline.

{"raw_input": "Andy Murray admitted Great Britain's Davis Cup win over the United States in his native Glasgow had been a 'very emotional' experience after he sealed victory with a straight-sets win over John Isner.

And Murray was proud to have been part of an effort that repeated Britain's win in San Diego at the same stage last year. The former Wimbledon champion said: 'The effort and attitude of everyone in the team was excellent. I feel we deserved to win because of that. 'Everyone fought extremely hard especially when we were behind in the matches, no-one gave up and everyone played every point extremely hard. 'It's a big win. It means a lot to everyone, all the staff and the players. 'There's a great synergy in the team and that builds the emotion and togetherness. It gives you that extra incentive to perform and fight for every single point. 'I was very emotional the whole weekend. I know the team extremely well, the players and the staff. 'I was proud of them as team-mates and also as friends and my brother of the way they performed and thought in this arena and under that much pressure. All of them did incredibly well.

Big-serving Isner hit 12 aces before the tie-break but some excellent backhand slices gave Murray the advantage and a brilliant lob saw him break in the second set. Murray stayed out of trouble in the third and his mental strength was again on show as he wrapped up the victory. 'I felt a little bit more pressure today to try to close it out and also the way John approached the match made it difficult,' he said. 'I knew James was extremely tired and it would be very tough ask for him to win that match after me. There is real pressure to help your team-mates out.

So I need to get going and I probably wouldn't have made my flight tonight. It was a dead rubber and I'm sure everyone understood the situation.' Isner later took the blame for his country's defeat. 'This one's on me,' he said. 'My team-mates may say otherwise but my loss on Friday put us in a huge hole. It's so, so disappointing for me. 'Beating Andy in this atmosphere, I tried my best, but there are not many people can beat him out there. 'What happened on Friday in my match hurt us. It's going to stick with me for a while. I feel like I let us down. It's a terrible feeling.'

{"raw_input": "Lynne Hughes, 33, suffers the rare sleep disorders narcolepsy and cataplexy. She falls asleep suddenly up to six times a day often collapses in the street . Waking from her sleep-walking state, Lynne Hughes was horrified to discover she had punched her husband in the face, breaking his nose. But the mother-of-two's outburst was not intentional or malicious. The 33-year-old is a diagnosed narcoleptic, and falls asleep without warning up to six times a day. She has woken to find she has sprayed Mr Muscle cleaning products on vegetables while cooking dinner and has come round to find she's made herself a sandwich. But for Mrs Hughes, who also suffers the related sleep disorder cataplexy, her illness has a serious side. Cataplexy causes a sufferer's muscles to completely relax, rendering a person unable to move, while remaining fully conscious. And twice while lying paralysed and helpless in a cataleptic state the street, she has been targeted by heartless thieves. Although she couldn't move, the 33-year-old felt hands raiding her pockets, removing her bank cards and mobile phone, while they pretended to help her. The conditions leave her prone to acting out her dreams as she sleep walks around the family's home in Mold, Flintshire. The bath has been removed, to prevent Mrs Hughes falling asleep in it, and she has stopped using a kettle. She said her 'life-changing' sleep episodes are often triggered by laughing or crying. She no longer goes out alone and never carries more than a few pounds in cash in her bag. She said: 'It's changed my life completely. 'On a couple of occasions I've been robbed. Remember, I can't move but I am still aware so I can feel their hands going into my pockets. 'It happened in Chester in about 2008 and then in Connah's Quay three years ago. 'It was people pretending to help me but really they took my bank cards and phone out of my pockets. 'I knew what was happening but couldn't do anything as the more stressed I got the worse the cataplexy got. 'I do not go out alone now.' Narcolepsy, which affects about 30,000 people in the UK, can cause excessive sleepiness and affects the brain's ability to regulate the normal sleep-wake cycle. Cataplexy is a co-existing condition which brings on episodes of muscular weakness triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, anger and surprise. In Mrs Hughes' case it causes her to regularly collapse, often after she has been laughing or crying. 'I've had to have my bath taken out because I wasn't safe to use it. I can't use a kettle either,' she said. 'My husband makes me a drink and puts it in the thermos flask.' Mrs Hughes has had many bad experiences in public when she collapses in uncomfortable or unfortunate places. She said: 'People will step over me if I fall down in Tesco. The mother-of-two, has woken from an episode to find she has punched her husband Richard, pictured, in the face, breaking his nose. And the 33-year-old has also sprayed Mr Muscle cleaner on vegetables while cooking dinner for her family. She said: 'It can be quite dangerous' Narcolepsy is a condition that affects around 0.05 per cent of a population. In the UK that equates to around 31,000 sufferers. It is a rare sleep disorder, which affects the brain's ability to regulate the normal sleep-wake cycle. It can cause symptoms including a disturbed night's sleep as well as excessive tiredness during the day. Normal sleep falls into a regular pattern of REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM stages. Every 90 minutes or so, a normal sleeper experiences several minutes of REM sleep, where dreaming occurs. They then switch back to non-REM sleep. But, for narcoleptics, their sleep pattern is much more fragmented. This causes them to wake up regularly. In addition, REM sleep can come on very quickly during the day and night, producing dream-like hallucinations. Cataplexy is an episode of muscular weakness triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, anger and surprise. The loss of muscle tone ranges from a just-perceptible weakening of the facial muscles through weakness at the knees, to total collapse on the floor. Speech is slurred, eyesight impaired (double vision, inability to focus) but hearing and awareness remain undisturbed. Attacks often last less than two minutes, and they may only last a few seconds. Some people have repeated attacks of cataplexy which persist for up to 30 minutes. During both mild and severe attacks, the person stays fully conscious. Cataplexy may be most severe when the subject is tired rather than fully alert and can lead to considerable anxiety although anxiety itself is not a trigger. It is thought that about 75 per cent of patients with narcolepsy have cataplexy. Source: Narcolepsy UK . 'The narcolepsy makes me do other strange things as well. I'll fall into automatic behaviour. 'My brain will cycle in and out of a sleep state and my body will carry on going, so I'll wake up to find I've made a sandwich. 'I have no fine motor skills though so I'll have put about a pound of butter and a whole chunk of cheese on a slice of bread. 'It can be quite dangerous too - I once sprayed our vegetables for dinner with Mr Muscle instead of Frylight oil, but my husband noticed in time.' The 33-year-old was formally diagnosed in 2009, but suspects her condition dates back longer than that. 'When I was a teenager I'd start sleeping between lessons and my friends would wake me up on a rota,' she said. 'I just thought I was tired but looking back I realise that was part of it. 'I'm basically the text-book worst-case scenario. I had to do away with the bath because I'd sink down and I could feel myself start to drown but I couldn't do anything about it. 'My husband used to have to be in the bathroom to keep an eye on me.' Mrs Hughes hopes her story will help raise awareness of the conditions she lives with. 'You either curl up and feel sorry for yourself or get on with it,' she added. 'My cataplexic episodes are triggered by strong emotion. 'I can have a fall if I start crying or fall if I laugh. There's no warning. My little boy calls it a 'splat'. 'During milder episodes my speech will slur. 'When I had my little boy in January 2007, during the pregnancy I fell down a lot. 'I lived in a maisonette with two sets of stairs and every check up I'd come in with a bruised hand, a bruised head or another bump.' After visiting a number of different specialists and doctors, some of whom mistook her condition for fatigue and depression, Mrs Hughes finally recognised her condition as being narcolepsy when she was watching a documentary. She said: 'I just thought, \"that's me.\" 'I went to my GP and was referred to a sleep centre in Aintree. I was diagnosed within a few months.'", "raw_output": "Lynne Hughes has been diagnosed with narcolepsy and cataplexy .\nShe falls asleep up to six times each day and drifts into a dream-like state .\n33-year-old's sleep episodes often triggered by laughing or crying .\nBroke husband Richard's nose after punching him in her sleep .\nMother-of-two has been robbed twice as she lay paralysed in the street .", "trunc_input": "Lynne Hughes, 33, suffers the rare sleep disorders narcolepsy and cataplexy.

The Ministry or Defence said that the stealth F35-B, which has been plagued by design flaws and technical setbacks, could not be flown within 28 miles of a thunderstorm. Named ‘Lightning II’, it was even at risk of its namesake while on the ground with pilots told to move it under cover if less than 11 miles away from a storm. RAF pilots have been banned from flying Lightning II fighter jets in a storm over fears it could explode . The fighter was created under  the U.S. 20-year Joint Strike Fighter programme, with the U.S. Government having ordered 2,500 of the Lockheed Martin planes. In Britain, 14 of the aircraft have been ordered to replace the ageing Harrier jump jet on the decks of the new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers. But a recent Pentagon report highlighted concerns over the placement of the jet's fuel tanks, which are located all the way through the wing, through the fuselage, around the inlets and back toward the engine. Pierre Sprey, a former Pentagon analyst who helped design the F-16 in the early 1970s, compared the engine to 'a blowtorch surrounded by fuel.' There was also a risk of catching fire if the fighter plane was shot at. Last June, an F-35 burst into flames as it was taxiing for take-off at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, because the engine had cracked during previous flights manoeuvres. One of the Pratt & Whitney engines broke apart, pushed through the top of the aeroplane, and caught fire while the pilot was preparing to take off. The entire fleet of F-35s was grounded for three weeks, and the plane missed its international debut. But that was not the end of problems for the fighter jets.

{"raw_input": "Luke Gale scored twice in a man-of-the-match performance as Castleford made it back-to-back wins for the first time this season with a 20-14 success over Hull FC at the Mend-A-Hose Jungle. The Tigers lost their first three matches but have found form in recent weeks and recorded their third successive home victory on Friday night. Defences came out on top in a first half which saw Castleford prop Andy Lynch take the field for his 450th career appearance against his former club. Castleford prop Andy Lynch took to the field for his 450th career appearance against his former club. Gale's converted effort gave the Tigers a deserved lead but Hull responded positively and went into the break with just a two-point deficit after Tom Lineham marked his 50th outing for the club with his fifth try of 2015. Lynch took centre stage at the start of the second period as his break laid the platform for Gale to cross for his second and stretch Castleford's lead. But Hull, whose coach Lee Radford missed the trip through illness, refused to lie down and hit the front as Lineham scored twice to complete his hat-trick. Opposite number Justin Carney gained some revenge when he grounded Lineham with a fierce hand-off on his way to the line for his ninth try of the campaign. James Clare eased Castleford's nerves after benefiting from Fetuli Talanoa's shocking error and they were celebrating their fourth successive win over Hull at full-time. The Tigers went close twice in the opening 10 minutes, with Jake Webster hauled down inches short of the tryline by Jordan Rankin and Clare dropping the ball attempting a spectacular finish in the corner. Castleford continued to do most of the running and finally broke Hull's resistance in the 24th minute as Gale showed a good turn of pace to score to the right of the posts after taking Grant Millington's brilliant offload 40 metres out. Hull came storming back and, just after former Tigers half-back Marc Sneyd had been denied by a last-ditch tackle by Carney, crossed for their first try of the evening through Lineham. The ball moved through the hands from left to right before Steve Michaels fed the winger to score in the corner. Sneyd missed the conversion from the right touchline so Castleford went into half-time 6-4 to the good. The hosts extended that lead within 60 seconds of the restart after Millington kept his composure to find Gale close to the line following a storming run by fellow prop Lynch. Castleford were again unable to build momentum as Lineham crossed to cut the home side's advantage to four points. Talanoa was denied by a good tackle by Clare but Lineham made no mistake in the other corner after collecting Danny Houghton's cut-out pass from dummy half. Sneyd was off target once more from out wide but he had been at the heart of all things good for the Black and Whites and his long pass allowed Lineham to complete his hat-trick. Sneyd made it third time lucky from the right to give Hull the lead for the first time on the night. Carney had been found wanting in defence for Castleford but the Australian showed why he is Super League's top try-scorer by flattening Lineham before diving over. Hull's hopes of mounting another comeback were hit when Sneyd limped off with a leg injury. Clare touched down after Talanoa made a meal of Gale's kick and the Tigers held on despite a late Hull onslaught.", "raw_output": "Luke Gale scored twice in a man-of-the-match performance .\nCastleford made it back-to-back wins for the first time this season .", "trunc_input": "Luke Gale scored twice in a man-of-the-match performance as Castleford made it back-to-back wins for the first time this season with a 20-14 success over Hull FC at the Mend-A-Hose Jungle.

The Tigers went close twice in the opening 10 minutes, with Jake Webster hauled down inches short of the tryline by Jordan Rankin and Clare dropping the ball attempting a spectacular finish in the corner. Castleford continued to do most of the running and finally broke Hull's resistance in the 24th minute as Gale showed a good turn of pace to score to the right of the posts after taking Grant Millington's brilliant offload 40 metres out. Hull came storming back and, just after former Tigers half-back Marc Sneyd had been denied by a last-ditch tackle by Carney, crossed for their first try of the evening through Lineham. The ball moved through the hands from left to right before Steve Michaels fed the winger to score in the corner. Sneyd missed the conversion from the right touchline so Castleford went into half-time 6-4 to the good. The hosts extended that lead within 60 seconds of the restart after Millington kept his composure to find Gale close to the line following a storming run by fellow prop Lynch. Castleford were again unable to build momentum as Lineham crossed to cut the home side's advantage to four points. Talanoa was denied by a good tackle by Clare but Lineham made no mistake in the other corner after collecting Danny Houghton's cut-out pass from dummy half. Sneyd was off target once more from out wide but he had been at the heart of all things good for the Black and Whites and his long pass allowed Lineham to complete his hat-trick. Sneyd made it third time lucky from the right to give Hull the lead for the first time on the night. Carney had been found wanting in defence for Castleford but the Australian showed why he is Super League's top try-scorer by flattening Lineham before diving over. Hull's hopes of mounting another comeback were hit when Sneyd limped off with a leg injury. Clare touched down after Talanoa made a meal of Gale's kick and the Tigers held on despite a late Hull onslaught.", "trunc_output": "Luke Gale scored twice in a man-of-the-match performance

{"raw_input": "(CNN)The story of the Jews in the United States is a testament to \"American exceptionalism\" and stands in contrast to a long history of discrimination and pariah status in Europe and Muslim lands. In fact, the economic prosperity and social standing of America's Jews shows that generally they have fared better than many other minorities. This positive record is a fulfillment of the assurance given to the Newport, Rhode Island, Hebrew Congregation in 1790 by President George Washington: \"It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it were the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights, for, happily, the Government of the United States ... gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.\"  Since then, American Jews have been appointed and elected to public offices as governors, senators, mayors, Cabinet officers and in the military, and today, most American adults are unaware of and don't seem to care who's Jewish. Thus it comes as a shock when at the University of California Los Angeles, a Jewish woman student applicant for the Student Council's Judicial Board is initially rejected after being asked: \"Given that you are a Jewish student and very active in the Jewish community, how do you see yourself being able to maintain an unbiased view?\" According to The New York Times, the discussion that followed had \"seemed to echo the kind of questions, prejudices and tropes -- particularly about divided loyalties -- that have plagued Jews across the globe for centuries.\" The minutes and video of the event suggest some student leaders seemed to be auditioning for the Salem witch trials and others for jobs as political commissars in Communist North Korea.  And in February, at another University of California campus in Davis, Jewish students opposed to a Student Council resolution advocating a boycott of Israel were heckled by cries of \"Allahu Akbar\" and a Jewish fraternity house was daubed with a swastika. Chancellor Gene Block of UCLA called the dust up on his campus a \"teachable moment.\"  Yes, agreed. It seems UCLA's diverse body of students requires remedial classes in civics. Would UCLA students consider it appropriate to ask U.S. Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan similarly hostile and demeaning questions? Apparently it's necessary for the university to teach its student leadership that the U.S. Constitution bans religious tests for public office.  While they are at it, they also can inform them that the Bill of Rights assures freedom of religion, speech and assembly to all citizens.  California's university administrators might need to be reminded that Title 6 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applies to all Americans, and they have an obligation to ensure equal educational opportunity for all students. This includes, among other things, promptly and effectively addressing certain hostile environments. As for the UC Davis students, they need to learn that support for Israel is a legitimate American tradition. A century ago, Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis asserted: \"Zionism is the Pilgrim inspiration and impulse all over again ... to be good Americans, we must be better Jews, and to be better Jews, we must become Zionists.\" Students are of course free to disagree with Brandeis but not to harass or intimidate Jews who support his argument. The events in California might be regarded as isolated incidents and youthful excesses of the type that has always marked campus life. Except of course that is not true. This type of hatred, stereotyping and bias is a worrying new development that suggests a generational problem. In our recent study, my Trinity College colleague, Ariela Keysar, and I found that 54% of Jewish students reported experiencing or witnessing ant-Semitism on campus during the six months of September 2013-March 2014. Our survey covered 1,157 Jewish students on 55 campuses. The patterns and high rates of anti-Semitism that were reported were surprising. Another finding was that female students were more likely than males (58% versus 51%) to report anti-Semitism. Jewish women seem more vulnerable on campus today.

{"raw_input": "A Danish tourist has died after trying to save a Michigan mayor from tempestuous waves on a beach in the Virgin Islands. South Lyon Mayor Tedd Wallace was pulled under the water while body-boarding in St Croix last Sunday. Rushing to his rescue was 70-year-old Gvind Matson, a Danish man on holiday with his wife to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their first kiss. Mr Wallace, 63, said Mr Matson also got caught in the choppy waters and as they both tried to cling to the board, he lost grip and never resurfaced. Rescue:  Mayor Tedd Wallace (right) was caught up in waves when a Danish man (not pictured) called Gvind Matson rushed to save him. He too got caught and never resurfaced. Bale Shbaka Kaza (left) came to his aid . Tribute: Mr Wallace posted this tribute to Mr Matson on Sunday afternoon after speaking to his widow . 'He didn't hesitate and took off after me,' Mr Wallace told The Detroit News. 'When he got to me we were both hanging on to the board and trying to paddle towards shore. I don't think we even said anything to each other. Suddenly he let go and went under. I think he had a heart attack right then.' He added: 'I feel so sorry for that man. 'Someone who gave their life for me ... I've been doing a lot of crying this week.'

'He didn't hesitate and took off after me,' Mr Wallace told The Detroit News. 'When he got to me we were both hanging on to the board and trying to paddle towards shore. I don't think we even said anything to each other. Suddenly he let go and went under. I think he had a heart attack right then.' He added: 'I feel so sorry for that man.

{"raw_input": "Robert Durst spent the night before his arrest wandering around New Orleans' French Quarter with a loaded .38-caliber revolver in his pocket, claims a nightclub doorman who accosted him. The millionaire real-estate heir and murder defendant was arrested on Saturday at the JW Marriott hotel, where cops found the gun and marijuana stashed in his room. John Phillips, 32, a doorman at the Mahogany Jazz Hall Burlesque and Absinthe House said Durst approached him just before midnight on Friday. Robert Durst spent the night before his arrest wandering around New Orleans' French Quarter with his loaded .38-caliber revolver in his pocket, claims a nightclub doorman . 'I asked him to come into the club, but he said in a female-ish soft voice, \"I would like to come in, but I can't right now,\"' Phillips told the New York Post. Durst, 71, then pulled open his brown-tweed suit jacket to reveal the butt of the gun in a belt holster, Phillips said. 'I thought to myself, I hope this old guy with a gun doesn't do anything stupid.' Phillips said that 'the whole exchange took less than a minute' outside the club and Durst 'just stumbled a little as he walked down the block.' 'I just thought he was an old man who was a little bit off. I kept thinking this old guy is on too much prescription medication.' Durst, 71, was arrested on the eve of Sunday's final episode of 'The Jinx: The Life And Deaths Of Robert Durst,' and he agreed on Monday to face trial for the murder of Susan Berman, who had vouched for him in public after his wife vanished. The final episode ended with the whispered words of Durst recorded in an unguarded moment in a bathroom. 'There it is. You're caught!' Durst whispered before the sound of water running can be heard. 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' John Phillips, 32, a doorman at the Mahogany Jazz Hall Burlesque and Absinthe House said Durst revealed to him that he was carrying a weapon . The whispered words of Durst recorded in an unguarded moment in a bathroom could come back to haunt him - or help him - as he faces a murder charge . Now those words could come back to haunt him — or help him — as he faces his murder charge. A possible move by prosecutors to introduce the incriminating material from a six-part documentary on his strange life and connection to three killings could backfire as interview footage did in the Michael Jackson molestation trial and the Robert Blake murder case. In both cases, the defense was allowed under the 'doctrine of completeness' to provide segments of interviews that presented their clients favorably without subjecting them to tough cross-examination. 'I submit that Blake didn't have to testify and Michael Jackson didn't have to testify because the prosecution foolishly wanted to introduce portions of their interviews,' said attorney Thomas Mesereau Jr., who represented both men. 'They just got greedy. They were mesmerized by portions they thought could help them.' In the Jackson case, the defense used unaired footage to counter damage done by Living With Michael Jackson, a damning documentary in which Jackson held hands with his accuser and spoke of letting children into his bed. 'I'd slit my wrists before I'd hurt a child,' Jackson said in one outtake shown by the defense, according to Mesereau, who won the performer's acquittal 10 years ago. Michael Jackson's lead defense attorney Thomas Mesereau Jr. said the so-called incriminating material from the Durst documentary could backfire as interview footage did in the Jackson molestation trial in 2005 . In the Durst case, prosecutors could seek to play portions from The Jinx that concluded with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live. He has been charged in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the 2000 killing Susan Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in New York in 1982. Durst, 71, who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $4 billion, has long denied killing Berman and Kathleen Durst, who was declared dead even though her body was never found. Investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with Berman when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near Beverly Hills. After the killing, Durst disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap Galveston, Texas, boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001. He claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder but convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man's body, which was found chopped up and floating in Galveston Bay. Actor Robert Blake, left, talks with his attorney, M. Gerald Schwartzbach: Prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with Barbara Walters because it contradicted other evidence . While legal experts said Durst's remarks off-camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible, prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing. 'I would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials,' said George Fisher, a former prosecutor and professor at Stanford Law School. 'The flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face.' In the case of Blake, prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with Barbara Walters because it contradicted other evidence. The defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview. 'It did a great deal both to humanize him and so he wasn't just seen as a celebrity,' said M. Gerald Schwartzbach, who won Blake's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife. 'There was an image projected that a lot of people had about Robert as a difficult person.

{"raw_input": "Jobless father-of-three Mario Bustamante-Leiva targeted City workers in London's bars, cafes and restaurants, stealing £21,000 worth of goods . One of London’s most prolific thieves has been jailed for three years after stealing £21,000 worth of phones, wallets and computers during a five-month crime spree. Jobless father-of-three Mario Bustamante-Leiva, 39, of no fixed address, wore a flat cap and a large overcoat even in the height of summer in order to conceal his pickings. The Chilean national trawled exclusive bars, restaurants and coffee shops looking for laptops, mobile phones, iPods and tablets. The Old Bailey heard in one case he even stole a bag containing an entire family’s passports and airplane boarding passes. Police have released CCTV footage which shows the brazen thief swipe an unsuspecting woman’s handbag from under her nose as she chats with a friend. Bustamante-Leiva can be seen hooking the bag with his foot before quickly leaving the cafe with the handbag tucked under his coat. He has now admitted 22 charges of theft between July and December 2014. Judge Christopher Morris QC branded Bustamante ‘dishonest to the fingertips’ as he sentenced him to three years in prison. The father-of-three was also sentenced to 12 months to be served concurrently for attempted burglary as he was convicted at Inner London Crown Court last November. Scroll down for video . His crime spree began in July 2014 in the City and his last offence was committed on November 28 2014, when he stole a bag and ipod at the ‘Counting House’ on Cornhill. City of London Police detectives identified him as a suspect in November 2014 after he stole a bag in Catch bar on Liverpool Street. Bustamante-Leiva was caught on CCTV snatching a woman's handbag as she sat in a London cafe . The footage shows him hooking his foot under the woman's chair in order to grab her handbag . As a result Crime Squad officers reviewed other similar crimes in the City and found that Bustamante-Leiva had also committed these offences. He was arrested on December 5 2014 when an officer spotted him entering ‘The Monument’ public house in the City, whilst listening to an iPod he had stolen from ‘The Counting House’ the previous week. ‘You are dishonest to your fingertips. Over a five month period you committed a series of thefts from the public, over that long period, to a total of some £21,000,’ the judge said. ‘Before you embarked upon that course of conduct, you had also committed the offence of attempted burglary. ‘I have no alternative, but to order that you be sent to prison.’ Bustamante-Leiva was arrested at the Monument pub in Fish Street Hill on December 5 whilst listening to an iPod he had stolen from The Counting House in Cornhill the previous week. ‘All counts relate to the theft of personal property from sandwich shops, bars and pubs in the City,’ said prosecutor Jennifer Newcomb. ‘He would enter the premises wearing a flat cap, large coat and backpack or large bag over his shoulder, even in the height of summer. ‘He would then stand or sit close to a person who had their bag on the floor or the back of a chair. Bustamante-Leiva then quickly ducks and grabs the bag after pulling it from underneath her chair . The footage shows him swiftly leaving the cafe as the unsuspecting woman continues to chat to a friend . ‘He would observe them and at an opportune moment remove the bag with his foot or the back of his hand. ‘After he obtained the bag he would hide it under his coat and leave the premises with the bag and its contents.’ Detective Sergeant David Morgan from the City of London Police said: ‘These crimes caused a massive inconvenience for the victims, along with anguish for the loss of both valuable and sentimental items, which far exceeds the financial cost of the thefts. ‘Although this thief is now behind bars we urge the public to be vigilant and look after their belongings when socialising in bars, coffee shops, restaurants and clubs. ‘If you witness any suspicious behaviour, please contact police immediately.’", "raw_output": "Mario Bustamante-Leiva, 39, stole wallets and computers worth £21,000 .\nChilean targeted City workers in exclusive cafes, bars and restaurants .\nEven stole a bag containing a family’s passports and boarding passes .\nJudge branded jobless Bustamante-Leiva ‘dishonest to the fingertips’\nHe admitted 22 charges of theft between 21 July and 5 December 2014 .\nBustamante-Leiva has now been sentenced to three years in jail .", "trunc_input": "Jobless father-of-three Mario Bustamante-Leiva targeted City workers in London's bars, cafes and restaurants, stealing £21,000 worth of goods .

{"raw_input": "His face twisted in fury, Abase Hussen punches his fist into the air and launches into an Islamic war cry. ‘Burn, burn USA,’ he yells from his prime spot at the front of one of the most notorious rallies in recent times. Once the crowd is whipped into a fever, an American flag is set on fire and held aloft by a fanatic. Video footage shows Mr Hussen desperately trying to hold the burning flag as the chanting behind him intensifies. Scroll down for video . Abase Hussen (circled right), whose daughter fled the UK last month to join ISIS, was pictured at an Islamic protest alongside Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebowale (circled left) Adebowale, who killed Lee Rigby alongside Michael Adebolajo, turns to reveal his face at the notorious rally . Vicious: In 2012, Abase Hussen (left) marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London, taking part in the burning of an American flag . He manages to grab the flag briefly before being forced to drop it because of the power of the smoke and flames. As the remainder of the flag burns on the ground, Mr Hussen chants ‘Allahu Akbar’. He pushes the palm of his hand repeatedly toward the embers, rejoicing at the destruction of the stars and stripes. Mr Hussen – the father of one of the three schoolgirls who fled Britain to join Islamic State – then turns his attention to a burning Israeli flag on the floor and begins to chant and gesture toward it. He is one of a dozen fanatics standing behind a banner which proclaims: ‘The followers of Mohammed will conquer America.’ Behind him, hundreds of fanatics repeatedly chant incendiary slogans while holding menacing black jihadi flags. Among the rabble-rousers was notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary, who has led a number of Islamist groups that were subsequently banned. Alongside him stood Michael Adebowale, one of the two Muslim converts who murdered and almost beheaded Fusilier Lee Rigby in the name of Allah eight months later. Sinister: Also at the rally was Adebowale who went on to murder soldier Lee Rigby the following year . Respectable: Abase Hussen, pictured far right, giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee following his daughter's disappearance. The report was released this week . Abu Izzadeen, infamous for heckling former Home Secretary John Reid in 2006, also led some of the chanting. But last month Mr Hussen gave evidence to Parliament refusing to accept any responsibility for the three schoolgirls’ actions, instead seeking to blame the police, teachers, Turkish officials and others. In an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee, Mr Hussen, who was with the families of the other two girls, denied even knowing what Islamic radicalisation was. Cuddly: Hussen appealing for the return of his 'jihadi daughter' a few weeks ago after she ran off . ‘As for me, I don’t know the symptoms even — what radicalisation is,’ he told MPs. Mr Hussen also repeatedly blasted the Metropolitan Police for handing a letter to his daughter requesting parental permission to speak to the girls about a friend who had earlier travelled to Syria. He said police officers should have given it directly to the families. He said: ‘I strongly disagree with the letter being given to 15-year-old girls. The word “police” by itself and “terrorism” or “counter-terrorism”, as global issues – it is a heavy burden for a 15-year-old to deal with that. We also feel that we are neglected as parents. ‘We are supposed to know these things. We are the guardians. The letter destructs our daughter, destructs our family and terrorises our children. What we want to know is: apart from this letter, what was the verbal conversation with this child? I know my daughter. She is the kind of girl who, if it is sunset, she will call me to pick her up. ‘How on earth she travelled abroad to join ISIS, is a very difficult question for us to answer – even to predicate. The letter terrified my daughter.’ The families were led by their lawyer Tasnime Akunjee, once the representative of a close associate of the Woolwich killers, who repeatedly demanded an apology. Mr Akunjee, who has posted extremist views on his Facebook page, accused Scotland Yard of a catalogue of errors in its handling of the disappearance of the trio in February and their close friend in December. In a 45-minute grilling in front of the families, Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe was forced to apologise for failing to communicate more directly with the families. Giving evidence to the committee, Mr Hussen claimed he did not know that his daughter Amira might have been exposed to radical views. Chairman Keith Vaz pressed him on this point, asking him: ‘Did it come to your attention in any way that they were involved in the kinds of things that it is alleged that they were involved in following this becoming public?’ Mr Hussen replied: ‘Not at all. Nothing.’ Chilling: A CCTV image of 15-year-old Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Shamima Begum, 15, at Gatwick Airport before they caught their flight to Turkey . Fanaticism: Footage of the controversial rally showed Mr Hussen chanting among the crowds of protesters. The demonstration, held in 2012, was led by firebrand preacher Anjem Choudary and attended by Lee Rigby's killer . Extremist: The protest was led by the hate preacher and notorious rabble rouser Anjem Choudary, who made a speech saying that Sharia would take over the entire world, including America and the UK . Shocking: Scotland Yard said it would examine the footage (pictured) to see if any criminal offences had been committed . What the MPs were not told was that Mr Hussen was caught on camera in one of a wave of demonstrations that took place across the world in September 2012. Thousands had taken to the streets to protest against an obscure film called Innocence of Muslims, criticised for ridiculing Islam. In London, more than 150 clashed with police outside the US embassy. They included Luton radicals Abu Rahin Aziz, who is fighting for Islamic State, and Saiful Islam, who was the subject of a Channel 4 exposé called Proud and Prejudiced. Radical: Amira Abase, 15, daughter of Abase Hussen, travelled to Syria with two other girls . Rahin Aziz has called for Theresa May to be executed, suggested that Islamic State-style executions take place in Trafalgar Square and threatened to blow up Big Ben. Last night members of the Commons committee expressed their shock and astonishment over Mr Hussen’s activities. Labour MP Ian Austin said: ‘It is extraordinary that this man blamed the police, the Government, the school, the Turkish government and everyone else for his daughter’s decision to go to Syria but failed to mention his own involvement in an appalling Islamist rally. Perhaps the committee should invite Mr Hussen back so he can explain what he was doing.’ Tory MP Michael Ellis, who also sits on the committee, said: ‘This will come as a surprise to those who heard criticism of the police and school. This raises serious questions about the potential negative influence on an impressionable young mind.’ Mr Vaz said: ‘It is clear that families and communities need to take greater responsibility for protecting young people who could be at risk of radicalisation. ‘Witnesses before the committee are responsible for their own statements. When Mr Hussen gave evidence, he said he had no idea that his daughter had been involved in radicalisation or had been radicalised.’ Amira fled with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from their homes in east London to Syria last month. The trio were following in the footsteps of Sharmeena Begum, who left their school, Bethnal Green Academy in East London, to go to Syria in December.

One motorist, in the Kruger National Park in South Africa got more than they bargained for, when they were trapped right in the middle of a pride of lions and a ginormous elephant. The small blue car was powerless to move as more than a dozen large cats from the Vurhami pride lay in its path, with a tusked elephant blocking the route behind. The nail-biting moment when a pride of lion gazes at a small car unable to move round them as it is trapped by a giant elephant behind .

The driver's path is blocked by a dozen cats, part of the Vurhami pride, relaxing on the safari road . Thankfully the car owner was in no danger, and waited for the elephant to continue its stroll, before managing to escape round the lazy cats. The dramatic photographs were taken by housewife Stella Stewart in 2013 and have only recently come to light. The 59-year-old housewife who took pictures from the car opposite, said the motorist was in no danger.

The elephant didn't even give it a second glance. 'But the lions on the other hand were very wary of both the car and elephant. 'I've seen lions and elephants road blocks but never together and a car stuck between them.' As the elephant slowly ambled to the other side of the road the driver, who has not been identified, calmly swerved round the side of the pride to avoid the lethargic cats. Phew!

She was a membership vice president while at the sorority and \"an integral part of our growing chapter,\" according to the chapter's Facebook page. \"She embodied the spirit of Gamma Sigma Sigma,\" the sorority said. \"As a person and friend, Emily always put others before herself and cared deeply for all those in her life.

She was a membership vice president while at the sorority and \"an integral part of our growing chapter,\" according to the chapter's Facebook page. \"She embodied the spirit of Gamma Sigma Sigma,\" the sorority said. \"As a person and friend, Emily always put others before herself and cared deeply for all those in her life. Emily will be greatly missed by her fellow sisters of Zeta.\" A music industry major, Emily Selke graduated with honors from the Philadelphia university, according to the school. She then went on to work around Washington for Carr Workplaces, a company that offers office space, meeting rooms and virtual offices, company spokesman Robert Beach said. \"We cherished Emily's work ethic, enthusiasm, humor and overall presence,\" said Beach, calling her \"dedicated, helpful and always willing to go the extra mile.\" \"Her genuine, bright smile and quick wit will be missed,\" he added. Yvonne Selke worked for Booz Allen Hamilton. Betty Thompson, an executive vice president with that consulting firm, described Yvonne as \"a wonderful co-worker and a dedicated employee\" in a statement to The Washington Post. Holmes said Yvonne Selke was \"a lovely spirit to be around,\" fiercely loyal to the people she loved. \"Our entire family is deeply saddened by the losses of Yvonne and Emily Selke. Two wonderful, caring, amazing people who meant so much to so many.  At this difficult time we respectfully ask for privacy and your prayers,\" the Selke family said in a statement.

{"raw_input": "A federal judge has ordered the US military to release photographs of detainees being abused in Iraq and Afghanistan . U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein's ruling on Friday gives the government, which has fought the case for over a decade, two months to decide whether to appeal before the photos could be released. The American Civil Liberties Union has been seeking to make them public in the name of holding government accountable. The fight over the photographs reaches back to the early years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it invokes the images of abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq that sparked international outrage after they emerged in 2004 and 2006. This image shows an unidentified detainee standing on a box with a bag on his head and wires attached to him at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. A federal judge has ordered that more pictures of inmate abuse must be shared by the US military . 'To allow the government to suppress any image that might provoke someone, somewhere, to violence would be to give the government sweeping power to suppress evidence of its own agents' misconduct,' said Jameel Jaffer, ACLU deputy legal director. 'Giving the government that kind of censorial power would have implications far beyond this specific context.' The Defense Department is studying the ruling and will make any further responses in court, spokesman Lt. Col. Myles Caggins III said. Early in the 2004 lawsuit, the ACLU pointed to the Abu Ghraib photos as priority examples of records the organization was seeking on the treatment of detainees. It's unclear how many more photographs may exist. The government has said it has 29 relevant pictures from at least seven different sites in Afghanistan and Iraq, and it's believed to have perhaps hundreds or thousands more, Hellerstein said in a ruling in August. He said some photos he had seen 'are relatively innocuous while others need more serious consideration,' and he has ruled that any images that would be released would be redacted to protect the identities of people in them. Some photographs, taken by service members in Iraq and Afghanistan, were part of criminal investigations of alleged abuse. Some images show 'soldiers pointing pistols or rifles at the heads of hooded and handcuffed detainees,' then-Solicitor General — now Supreme Court Justice — Elena Kagan wrote in an appeal to the high court earlier in the case, which has taken a long road through the courts and Congress. The fight over the photographs reaches back to the early years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it invokes the images of abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq (inside pictured) that sparked international outrage after they emerged in 2004 and 2006 . The government has long argued that releasing the photographs could incite attacks against U.S. forces and government personnel abroad, and officials have said that risk hasn't abated as the U.S. military role in Iraq and Afghanistan lessened. Indeed, 'the danger associated with release of these photographs is heightened now,' amid the rise of the Islamic State militant group, Navy Rear Adm. Sinclair Harris, the vice director for operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a December court filing.

U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein's ruling on Friday gives the government, which has fought the case for over a decade, two months to decide whether to appeal before the photos could be released. The American Civil Liberties Union has been seeking to make them public in the name of holding government accountable. The fight over the photographs reaches back to the early years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it invokes the images of abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq that sparked international outrage after they emerged in 2004 and 2006. This image shows an unidentified detainee standing on a box with a bag on his head and wires attached to him at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. A federal judge has ordered that more pictures of inmate abuse must be shared by the US military . 'To allow the government to suppress any image that might provoke someone, somewhere, to violence would be to give the government sweeping power to suppress evidence of its own agents' misconduct,' said Jameel Jaffer, ACLU deputy legal director. 'Giving the government that kind of censorial power would have implications far beyond this specific context.' The Defense Department is studying the ruling and will make any further responses in court, spokesman Lt. Col. Myles Caggins III said. Early in the 2004 lawsuit, the ACLU pointed to the Abu Ghraib photos as priority examples of records the organization was seeking on the treatment of detainees. It's unclear how many more photographs may exist. The government has said it has 29 relevant pictures from at least seven different sites in Afghanistan and Iraq, and it's believed to have perhaps hundreds or thousands more, Hellerstein said in a ruling in August. He said some photos he had seen 'are relatively innocuous while others need more serious consideration,' and he has ruled that any images that would be released would be redacted to protect the identities of people in them. Some photographs, taken by service members in Iraq and Afghanistan, were part of criminal investigations of alleged abuse. Some images show 'soldiers pointing pistols or rifles at the heads of hooded and handcuffed detainees,' then-Solicitor General — now Supreme Court Justice — Elena Kagan wrote in an appeal to the high court earlier in the case, which has taken a long road through the courts and Congress. The fight over the photographs reaches back to the early years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it invokes the images of abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq (inside pictured) that sparked international outrage after they emerged in 2004 and 2006 . The government has long argued that releasing the photographs could incite attacks against U.S. forces and government personnel abroad, and officials have said that risk hasn't abated as the U.S. military role in Iraq and Afghanistan lessened. Indeed, 'the danger associated with release of these photographs is heightened now,' amid the rise of the Islamic State militant group, Navy Rear Adm. Sinclair Harris, the vice director for operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a December court filing. Islamic State, he said 'would use these photographs to further encourage its supporters and followers to attack U.S. military and government personnel.' Amid the lawsuit, Congress passed a 2009 law allowing the government to keep the photos secret if the secretary of defense certified that unveiling them would endanger U.S. citizens or government or military personnel.

{"raw_input": "(CNN)A shooting at a bar popular with expatriates in Mali on Saturday killed five people, including French and Belgian citizens, authorities said. One French citizen, one Belgian and three Malians were killed in the attack in the capital of Bamako, said Gabriel Toure, director of a local hospital. An additional eight people were wounded, he said. Authorities called the shooting a \"criminal and terrorist act.\" \"Mali remains committed to seeking peace and will not be intimidated by those who have no other motives than to do away (with) the prospects of peace and harmony amongst the Malians,\" the government said in a statement. A North African jihadist group, al-Murabitun, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Mauritanian news agency Al Akhbar. The purported claim came in an audio message in which the group said it carried out the attack in retaliation for the killing of one of its leaders, Al Akhbar said. \"Al-Murabitun may be considered a regional competitor to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM),\" according to the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based research and analysis firm. The U.S. State Department said in January that al-Murabitun is a \"newly-formed\" militant group that has presence in northern Mali. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the victim from his country was 31 years old. French President Francois Hollande released a statement condemning the attack. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed his condolences to the victims' families in a news conference in Paris on Saturday. \"This is an act of cowardice,\" he said. \"But an act of opening fire in a restaurant filled with innocent civilians -- in the end, that only strengthens our resolve to fight terrorism in all of its forms, wherever it exists.\" The French Embassy in Bamako warned its citizens to be on alert if they go out in public. Though it's unclear whether any rebel group is responsible for the attack, Malian forces have battled Islamist militants in the northern part of the nation for years. Fabius said the Malian government was interrogating some suspects. Mali plunged into chaos after soldiers staged a coup three years ago. As a result, Tuareg fighters capitalized on the power vacuum to launch an insurgency that ended with their takeover of the north. After the Tuareg fighters seized the region, a power struggle erupted with local Islamist radicals. The extremists toppled the tribe and seized control of a large piece of northern Mali, an area the size of France. Since then, the nation has battled various rebel factions, mostly in the northern region, with the help of French and African forces.

{"raw_input": "Puppy killer Nathan Thompson has spoken out after his court hearing claiming he is a dog lover. The 25-year-old pleaded guilty to four counts of animal cruelty and as a result, has been banned from owning, acquiring, buying or possessing any animal for a decade.

But he 'loved his dog' and was shattered that she was confiscated.

The  25-year-old allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon and bashed a number of them to death with a rock. Police say an advertisement on Gumtree was placed online last Thursday for the sale of 11 Bull Terrier cross puppies. Almost a week later, it is alleged the owner had not sold the dogs and offered the puppies free of charge to the 25-year-old who accepted. It's alleged that a witness saw the 25-year-old man begin to kill a number of the puppies, aged six to eight weeks, by hitting them over the head with a rock, then throwing them into the bush. The witness confronted the man, who drove from the area with five of the dogs still alive. The RSPCA were contacted and attended the location, before taking the attacked puppies to a vet. Only one of the animals, named Lucky, survived. David O'Shannessy, told Daily Mail Australia on Friday he was shocked by the incident. 'We deal with a lot of cases but in this particular incident someone has allegedly gone out of their way to do something to the dogs which makes it even more concerning for us,' he said. 'This sort of situation doesn't have to occur.' Mr O'Shannessy says by the time the RSPCA arrived at the scene only two dogs were alive. Nathan Thompson, the man accused of horrifically murdering 10 puppies,  pleaded guilty to four counts of animal cruelty . 'There were seven pups in total when we arrived and five of them were deceased,' he said. 'Most of them had significant head injuries so you can image what the scene was like when we got there. 'The inspectors quickly transported the surviving dogs to the clinic but one of them died on the way.' Police and RSPCA arrested the 25-year-old at a house in Kurri Kurri on Thursday. Police say the man allegedly told them four of the five remaining puppies were destroyed and the fifth was re-homed. 'Something's not quite right with the numbers so we've made some inquiries about the other dogs,' Mr O'Shannessy said. Lucky, the surviving dog, is in the care of the RSCPA and is stable and has improved significantly despite serious head injuries.

Murray took time out of his preparation for the World Group encounter with the United States to take a private tour of Hampden Park. The Scot admits he will be nervous when he turns out in front of his home crowd on Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the Emirates Arena and his trip to a more established Scottish sporting venue helped him reflect on the encounter to come. Andy Murray hits a shot as part of his practice session at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow on Wednesday . Murray, wearing a t-shirt with a tweet from a fan pledging support, is part of the British team taking on the USA . The recently-announced World No 5 will have the backing of home support in Glasgow this week . Murray said: 'I just went and had a little walk around and saw the locker rooms and changing areas and went on to the pitch, which was nice. 'I had only been once to Hampden before for a cup final which Hibs lost. Surprise. 'It was nice to go down on the pitch and see what it was like.' The Emirates Arena will only hold about a seventh of Hampden's 50,000 capacity but Murray expects the crowd to play a significant role in the first-round encounter. 'For all of us as a team, getting to play in front of a crowd like this is a great feeling,' said the world number five, whose brother Jamie missed media duties as he bids to recover from a minor cold. 'I would say that's the nicest thing about the Davis Cup, when you get a home tie you get the whole crowd behind you. It's not like that at the tournaments we play throughout the rest of the year. 'To have a crowd turning up just to support you is fantastic and I'm sure the whole team will respond. 'It looks like a great arena, it's a perfect size and if it's packed I am sure they will make a lot of noise. 'It helps in all sports to play in front of a home crowd. There can sometimes be a few nerves early because of it but once you get through that it makes a big difference and can help a lot.'

We believe in you! #BackTheBrits' Ward and Murray face a tough task to repeat last year's win over the US on the arena's indoor hard court . Murray joked that James Ward was 'piling the pressure on' when his fellow singles player stated that the Australian Open finalist would be a clear favourite in his games, but he later appeared relaxed over the prospect of meeting expectations. 'I have always viewed nerves as a very positive thing,' the 27-year-old said. 'When you actually learn what nerves are and why they come, it's positive to feel nervous. 'I have always felt like I have been able to concentrate better when I have had nerves in the morning or the night before. 'I feel like my body responds well to it, that I move better and see the ball better. It's just making sure you are able to make the right decisions in those moments. I think, well I hope I will deal with it well on Friday but who knows?' Murray shares a laugh with Great Britain's Davis Cup team captain Leon Smith during the training session . Murray gave short shrift to questions on the effect his support for Scottish independence in last year's referendum would have on his commitment to the Great Britain team, having explained his decision to come out in support a 'yes' vote in a recent interview.

Murray admitted he had missed the influence of coach Amelie Mauresmo, who was occupied with France Fed Cup duties when Murray lost to Gilles Simon and then Croatian teenager Borna Coric in Rotterdam and Dubai respectively. 'I feel I have practised pretty well here,' he said. 'I took a couple of days off after Dubai and got here and started trying to work on a couple of things and get myself back on the right track. 'After the Aussie Open I spent the next three or four weeks with no coach and I feel that's something I obviously need to get sorted so that when I get to the clay court season I am not in that position, because I feel like there are some things I need to work on all the time and when I don't have somewhere there it's harder to do that.

{"raw_input": "Manchester City and Chelsea are set to challenge Manchester United for the services of Gareth Bale this summer. The pressure on Bale at Madrid has intensified in recent weeks and a move back to the Premier League is on the cards. It has been assumed that if Bale does leave Madrid then a move to United is a 'shoo-in'. But both Chelsea and City are in need of attacking stimulus, especially in the context of Champions League football. Gareth Bale is attracting criticism in the Spanish capital and Chelsea and Manchester City are interested . The reality is that it will be how each club manage to finance a £100million deal plus near £300,000-a-week wages and stay within FFP rules. And in the case of Manchester United they have priorities in other areas of the pitch. Chelsea, on the basis of transfer sales and turnover, will have the ability to push the boat out to get Bale. The Blues are also looking to sign Real Madrid centre-half Raphael Varane. Chelsea could demand as much as £20million this summer to let Petr Cech leave the club. In what may well be a merry-go-round of elite goalkeepers this summer, Cech is a target for Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool, Manchester United, Real Madrid and PSG. Although Cech is now Chelsea’s No 2, he is still just 32. Former Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann has urged the Gunners to sign Cech, arguing that he could well be entering the best period of his career. Petr Cech is wanted by a raft of top clubs and Arsenal have been urged to sign him by Jens Lehmann . Liverpool are prepared to play poker with Raheem Sterling and his advisors over a new contract. And the Merseyside club remain convinced they will win. The Reds don’t believe there is genuine, firm interest from clubs such as Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Chelsea or Manchester United as has been reported, as talks over a new £100,000 a week deal have repeatedly stalled. Certainly Liverpool believe that if they slap a £50million-plus price tag on the England forward then none of those clubs would make a move this summer. Raheem Sterling is reportedly wanted by Europe's elite, but Liverpool aren't buying that . Talks on a bumper £1000,000-a-week deal have stalled between Sterling and Liverpool . Indeed the club believe Sterling constantly being linked with a range of 'platinum' clubs is part of a strategy from the player’s camp to force their hand and offer wages of up to £140,000 a week - the sort of level Steven Gerrard and Luis Suarez were on. But the view of the Liverpool hierarchy is that in stages of progression Sterling does not yet command such a figure in the context of their wage structure nor in how they deal with FFP regulations. The club want Sterling to understand that the current offer is generous, especially given that despite his rapid emergence he has yet to prove himself as a consistent force, and that a new £100,000-a-week five-year deal would have re-negotiation stages built in. The obvious concern of the club is that if they bow to the demands of Sterling’s advisors now, they could have a talented 20-year-old player on their hands who suddenly lacks sufficient motivation and incentive to fulfil his potential. Brendan Rodgers bluntly told Sterling not to wave goodbye to Liverpool . It was telling that manager Brendan Rodgers said pointedly on Saturday: ‘I think it is quite obvious when you look at it is that anyone with his [Sterling’s] best interests at heart knows his best option is to sign a new deal for Liverpool.’ The club also doesn’t want to unsettle the rest of the squad by bowing to Sterling's demands. Liverpool are also relaxed about the situation not least because Sterling’s current contract does not expire until the summer of 2017. Sam Allardyce's days are numbered as West Ham manager. The club are set to sever his contract on May 25, the day after the last game of the season against Newcastle. Even if the Hammers have a good end to the season there is no way back for Allardyce whose current contract expires in July. The 3-0 defeat at Arsenal took West Ham's Premier League run to just one win in 12. Sam Allardyce looks aggrieved during West Ham's latest capitulation at the Emirates . The West Ham board still harbour hopes of luring Carlos Tevez to the club next season from Juventus in their last season at the Boleyn Ground before moving to the Olympic Stadium. The club’s hierarchy see former cult hero Tevez as a platinum signing that can help attract a new fan base. Carlos Tevez is wanted by the Hammers as a marquee signing in their final year at Upton Park . Everton could move for Chelsea’s misfit striker Loic Remy this summer if they decide to cash in on wantaway Romelu Lukaku. Radamel Falcao, as revealed by the Football Grapevine, will not stay at Manchester United beyond this season’s loan deal from Monaco, where indeed the Colombian could well be playing his football again next season. Radamel Falcao could return to Monaco after a frustrating first year in the Premier League . I am hearing . Tottenham’s Danny Rose is set to get an England call-up for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania later this month to prevent him opting to declare for Jamaica. BTW . Luis Suarez last week claimed it was English media which forced him to quit Liverpool last summer and join Barcelona. Utter tosh. The main reason Suarez left Liverpool is because he had been hankering for a dream move to Spain for over a year. And he also wanted to nearly double his salary. Luis suarez looks glum as Liverpool's title hopes evaporate on a crazy night at Selhurst Park last year . Suarez grins from ear to ear as the Uruguayan is turning it on for La Liga leaders Barcelona . Yes the press reported various indiscretions by the Uruguayan, including a race row, a propensity to dive and a habit of assaulting opponents from time to time. That’s part of the job. What did Suarez expect? High fives? Or flowers? Yet for all that, the English press still honoured Suarez last season when the Football Writers Association (FWA) voted him as their player of the year. That’s hardly hounding a player out, is it? I-Say . Jamie Carragher labelled the behaviour of Chelsea players in Champions League defeat by PSG as a ‘disgrace’. Fellow Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness described the manner in which the Chelsea players pressurised referee Bjorn Kuipers to send off Zlatan Ibrahimovic as pathetic. Ibrahimovic called the Chelsea players ‘babies’. I can’t disagree with any of those verdicts. I just found it embarrassing. Yet in the commentary box, Gary Neville almost paid the Chelsea players a compliment by calling them ‘shrewd’. Really? Chelsea players surround Bjorn Kuipers as the Dutch official sends off Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Matches between Manchester United and Tottenham have often been entertaining and full of goals down the years, although this season’s encounter at White Hart Lane ended 0-0. Coral offer 12-1 on the same outcome. For the more adventurous, they offer 50-1 for 3-3. Harry Kane is 6-1 to be first scorer. Shrewd is being clever, not cheating then is it? Does an employee of the Football Association - Neville has a role as England boss Roy Hodgson’s assistant - advocate cheating? Let’s not forget one of the main roles of the FA is to act as custodians of the game, uphold discipline and even offer a moral lead. Once again there would seem a conflict of interest with Neville being an opinionated media pundit AND a senior member of the England coaching staff. After all, do we want to see England players acting in the same pathetic manner, as Souness put it, as the Chelsea players did last week? I think not.", "raw_output": "Gareth Bale's suitors now include Chelsea and Manchester City .\nChelsea may put a £20m price tag on Petr Cech .\nWest Ham want a sensational reunion with Carlos Tevez .\nLiverpool are convinced there is no interest from Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Chelsea or Manchester United in Sterling .\nAnd they will test that theory by slapping on a £50m price tag .", "trunc_input": "Manchester City and Chelsea are set to challenge Manchester United for the services of Gareth Bale this summer.

{"raw_input": "A Dallas woman faces up to 20 years in federal prison for her role in the overdose death of a 19-year-old apparent first-time heroin user. Rian Lashley, whose teenage YouTube debut revealed a talented and beautiful singer rife with potential, died in March 2014 after a stripper's implausible attempt to rob her of $3,000 went terribly wrong. That stripper, Cierra Rounds, gave her disgusting account of the ill-fated plot in court on Tuesday as she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance. Sad: 19-year-old Rian Lashley was killed in an attempt to rob her by injecting her with heroin that went terribly wrong, prosecutors say. Dallas stripper Cierra Rounds, right, revealed in court Tuesday the calamitous chain of events that led to Lashley's demise . The trouble began when Rounds, along with some of her friends, met with the young woman at a Plano, Texas IHOP in order to sell her $100 worth of heroin. While they ate, the New York Daily News reports, Rounds and her friend Kathryn Dirks, 25, came to discover that Lashley was carrying $3,000 cash ion her purse. Rounds soon reached out to her drug dealer, identified as J.C. or Jaymo, NBCDFW reports, and the plan was hatched. 'I figured ud (sic) want me on this money,' Rounds texted J.C. The trio then drove to a home in Dallas. J.C. told Rounds via text message to keep Lashley there. 'Ima bout (sic) to shoot her up for her first time,' Rounds said. At the home, prosecutors say Rounds and Dirks, at Lashley's request, injected heroin into the teen. Tragic: The trouble began when Rounds, along with some of her friends, met with Lashley at a Plano, Texas IHOP in order to sell her $100 worth of heroin . China White: The 19-year-old had never done heroin. She was sold three bags of China White by Rounds' cohort Glen Brunton, according to prosecutors . Little girl lost: Lashley's funeral home obituary page is covered in heartfelt condolences to Lashley's family, as well as photos from her painfully innocent-looking upbringing . Later that afternoon, Lashley began to appear distressed. Rounds said Tuesday that they then put the teen in a bathtub of ice water in order to try to counteract the heroin. She appeared to go to sleep thereafter and died that afternoon. An autopsy revealed her death was due to heroin overdose. Dirks and a man to whom J.C. gave the heroin to sell to Lashley, 28-year-old Glen Brunton, were indicted on drugs charges last year, the Dallas Morning News reports. Brunton goes to trial in April. Dirks is still a fugitive. Rounds remains jailed pending sentencing and faces a $1 million fine along with her potential jail time. She returns to court in September.

Tragic: The trouble began when Rounds, along with some of her friends, met with Lashley at a Plano, Texas IHOP in order to sell her $100 worth of heroin . China White: The 19-year-old had never done heroin. She was sold three bags of China White by Rounds' cohort Glen Brunton, according to prosecutors . Little girl lost: Lashley's funeral home obituary page is covered in heartfelt condolences to Lashley's family, as well as photos from her painfully innocent-looking upbringing . Later that afternoon, Lashley began to appear distressed. Rounds said Tuesday that they then put the teen in a bathtub of ice water in order to try to counteract the heroin. She appeared to go to sleep thereafter and died that afternoon. An autopsy revealed her death was due to heroin overdose. Dirks and a man to whom J.C. gave the heroin to sell to Lashley, 28-year-old Glen Brunton, were indicted on drugs charges last year, the Dallas Morning News reports. Brunton goes to trial in April. Dirks is still a fugitive. Rounds remains jailed pending sentencing and faces a $1 million fine along with her potential jail time. She returns to court in September.

{"raw_input": "Newly elected Afghan President Ashraf Ghani admitted to his love of corned beef sandwiches from Katz's Deli in New York on Wednesday as he addressed Congress in Washington, D.C. at a formal dinner in his honor. 'I was another beneficiary of America’s wonderful generosity,' president Ghani said. 'I ate corned beef at Katz’s, New York’s greatest, greasiest, pickle-lined melting pot,' he added as the room erupted in unanimous laughter. Katz's, established in 1888, is the oldest delicatessen in New York City. Peaceful meeting: President of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani  delivered an address to a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday where he expressed his love for Katz's Deli in New York . The establishment is open daily staring at 8:00am and is open all night on Friday and Saturday. For 18.75 a patron can scoop up Ghani's favorite Corned Beef creation. 'Our secret \"dry cure\" pickling formula requires a full month to be ready to serve,' says Katz's website of the delicacy. 'The secret to finishing is to pace yourself,' adds the New York staple's page. Ghani also thanked Congress for slowly but surely helping to rebuild his country following the Afghanistan war in 2001. He expressed his gratitude for the millions of American tax dollars and vowed his war-wracked country will be self-reliant within this decade. 'We're not going to be the lazy Uncle Joe,' he said. President's favorite: 'I was another beneficiary of America’s wonderful generosity,' president Ghani said. 'I ate corned beef at Katz’s, New York’s greatest, greasiest, pickle-lined melting pot,' Ghani said on Wednesday . In a speech to a joint meeting of Congress, Ghani moved to mend U.S.-Afghan relations that were frayed under former President Hamid Karzai. Lawmakers have been critical about the lengthy U.S. troop presence in America's longest war, wasteful spending in Afghanistan and were stung by Karzai's anti-American rhetoric. Ghani humbly thanked Congress for the nearly $107 billion it has appropriated for Afghanistan so far. He paid homage to the 2,200 U.S. servicemen and -women who lost their lives in the war and the thousands more who were wounded, and thanked the U.S. aid workers who built schools, wells and cured the sick. 'At the end of the day, it is the ordinary Americans whose hard-earned taxes have over the years built the partnership that has led to our conversation today,' he said to applause in the House chamber packed with hundreds of lawmakers, dignitaries and guests. Ghani, wearing a gray western suit, peppered his speech with anecdotes about the time he's spent in America, noting that he graduated from Columbia University in New York and was in his World Bank office in Washington when the first plane smashed into the World Trade Center on 9/11. He touched on themes he hoped would convince lawmakers that he will be a reliable U.S. partner. Oldest Deli: Katz's, established in 1888, is the oldest delicatessen in New York City and is home to their famous corned beef sandwich . He admitted that decades of war have resulted in high levels of fraud and graft in Afghanistan and promised to eliminate corruption. Ghani also voiced support for women's rights and said he would emphasize law and justice and focus on self-reliance and economic development. 'We don't want your charity. We have no more interest in perpetuating a childish dependence than you have in being saddled with a poor family member who lacks the energy and drive to get out and find a job,' Ghani said. That's a tall order for Afghanistan. The national unity government that Ghani runs with chief executive Abdullah Abdullah has not yet seated a full cabinet, and some of the country's 30-plus provinces are still run by acting governors. The country recently had a $500 million budget shortfall and domestic revenues missed targets by 26 percent, forcing the U.S. to step in in recent months to help cover the fiscal gap. More than a third of Afghans live below the poverty line and the nation's vast mineral resources remain virtually untapped. Afghanistan also is not at peace, and Ghani's efforts to lure the Taliban to reconciliation talks have not yet been fruitful. Just hours before he spoke, at least six people were killed and more than 30 were wounded in a suicide car bombing near the presidential palace in Kabul. Ghani is untested as a leader, yet he received a warm reception from both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. The reason: He's not Karzai. Expressed Gratitude: Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani expresses his country's gratitude for America's fiscal commitment, military sacrifices, and last but not least corned beef from Katz's Deli . House Speaker John Boehner issued a statement after the speech calling Ghani a 'trusted partner.' And just before Ghani stepped from the chamber, he and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee, embraced in a bear hug. Obama said the U.S. would leave its 9,800 troops in Afghanistan in place rather than downsizing to 5,500 by year's end. The size of the U.S. footprint for next year is still to be decided, Obama said, but he brushed aside any speculation the withdrawal will bleed into 2017. That means the slowdown won't jeopardize his commitment to end America's involvement in Afghanistan before leaving office. Obama slowed the pace of the withdrawal because of deficiencies in the Afghan security forces, heavy casualties in the ranks of the army and police, the need for the Ghani-Abdullah government to gain traction and fears that Islamic State fighters could gain a foothold in Afghanistan. Ghani said IS militants, also known as Daesh, pose a 'clear and present danger' to Afghanistan, and he challenged Muslim leaders and intellectuals who believe that Islam is a religion of tolerance and virtue to speak out against Islamic extremism. 'If al-Qaida was - with all due respect to Microsoft - Windows I, Daesh is Windows 5,' Ghani said. 'It's fast. It is brutal, but it is extraordinarily quick.' Ghani's speech drew much applause, but his appearance didn't create as much buzz in the Capitol as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did when he spoke to Congress earlier this month. Some Democrats skipped the Israeli leader's speech, in which he warned the U.S. that an emerging international agreement the U.S. was trying to reach with Tehran would pave Iran's path to developing nuclear weapons.", "raw_output": "Newly elected Afghan President Ashraf Ghani admitted to his love of corned beef sandwiches from Katz's Deli in New York .\n'I ate corned beef at Katz’s, New York’s greatest, greasiest, pickle-lined melting pot,' Ghani told Congress in Washington on Wednesday .\nAshraf Ghani stepped up to speak at a formal dinner in his honor this week at the State Department where he expressed his gratitude .", "trunc_input": "Newly elected Afghan President Ashraf Ghani admitted to his love of corned beef sandwiches from Katz's Deli in New York on Wednesday as he addressed Congress in Washington, D.C. at a formal dinner in his honor.

{"raw_input": "The founding father of modern Singapore who was both feared and admired for turning the city-state into one of the world's richest nations, has died. He was 91. Lee Kuan Yew was admitted to Singapore General Hospital on February 5 for severe pneumonia and was later put on life support. The Prime Minister's Office said in a statement posted on its website that Lee 'passed away peacefully' at the hospital at 3.18am Monday local time. Scroll down for video . Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew (pictured in 2004) has died in hospital. He was 91 . Well-wishers lay flowers and cards outside Singapore General Hospital after he became critically ill . He was admitted to Singapore General Hospital last month for severe pneumonia and later put on life support . The country's first and longest-serving prime minister, Lee guided Singapore through a traumatic split with Malaysia in 1965 and helped transform what was then a sleepy port city into a global trade and finance center. Although he could have remained in office for much longer, he stepped aside and handed over leadership of the ruling party, and the country, to a younger generation in 1990. 'In the end, my greatest satisfaction in life comes from the fact that I have spent years gathering support, mustering the will to make this place meritocratic, corruption-free and equal for all races - and that it will endure beyond me, as it has,' Lee said in his 2013 book, 'One Man's View of the World.' David Cameron said Mr Lee had transformed Singapore into one of the great success stories of the modern world. Mr Lee was hailed as having provided a number of British prime ministers with advice over the years and was once singled out by the late Margaret Thatcher as the prime minister she most admired. Mr Cameron said: 'That Singapore is today a prosperous, secure and successful country is a monument to his decades of remarkable public service. He was always a friend to Britain, if sometimes a critical one, and many British Prime Ministers benefited from his wise advice, including me. 'Lady Thatcher once said that there was no Prime Minister she admired more than Mr Lee for \"the strength of his convictions, the clarity of his views, the directness of his speech and his vision of the way ahead\". 'His place in history is assured, as a leader and as one of the modern world's foremost statesmen.' Former prime minster Sir John Major said Mr Lee was 'one of the political giants of recent history'. 'He was the architect of modern Singapore, and led the way in changing it from a small island country in Malaysia to the thriving, competitive state that it is today, punching well above its weight and admired across the world. Margaret Thatcher chats with Lee Kuan Yew on the steps of 10 Downing Street . 'Few men left a better legacy to their nation than Lee Kuan Yew, and we may not see his like again. He really was a remarkable leader, and will be much missed by those of us who were privileged to know him and work with him.' President Barack Obama also offered his condolences, calling Mr Lee 'a true giant of history.' Obama said in a White House statement that he appreciated Lee's wisdom, including during discussions they held on the president's trip to Singapore in 2009 when the president was formulating his Asia-Pacific policy. 'He was a true giant of history who will be remembered for generations to come as the father of modern Singapore and as one the great strategists of Asian affairs.' U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was 'deeply saddened' by Lee's death and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the country would continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with Singapore as the region saluted one of its giants. Lee's legacy includes an efficient government with little corruption, low tax rates to attract foreign investment, excellent schools and clean and safe streets, all of which have helped Singapore rank consistently near the top of surveys of the most livable cities for expatriates. He faced criticism, though, for using tough tactics to consolidate power. He jailed some political rivals without trial for decades and brought defamation lawsuits against journalists and opposition politicians, which had a chilling effect on dissent. 'I had to do some nasty things, locking fellows up without trial,' Lee said in an interview with The New York Times published in September 2010. 'I'm not saying everything I did was right. But everything I did was for an honorable purpose.' One of his sons, Lee Hsien Loong, is Singapore's current prime minister. He also is survived by another son, Lee Hsien Yang, and a daughter, neurologist Lee Wei Ling. His wife of more than 60 years, Kwa Geok Choo, died in October 2010. Born September 23, 1923, Lee grew up speaking English in a Singapore that was part of the British colonial empire, and was known as Harry during much of his early life. His university education was interrupted by the three-year Japanese occupation of the island in the Second World War. The Queen and Mr Lee share a light moment together during a state banquet at the Indonesian presidential palace in 1989 . Mr Lee shakes hands with former Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street in 2003 . 'The Japanese demanded total obedience, and got it from nearly all,' he wrote in his memoirs. 'My appreciation of governments, my understanding of power as the vehicle for revolutionary change, would not have been gained without this experience.' After completing his studies at Singapore's Raffles College, Lee went to England to study law at Cambridge University. There, he married Kwa, a fellow student, in 1947. He returned to Singapore in 1950 and started the law firm Lee & Lee with his wife in 1955. In 1954, Lee helped found the People's Action Party and he became Singapore's first prime minister in 1959 when Britain granted it self-governance in all matters except defense and foreign affairs. Singapore declared independence from Britain in 1963, and Lee, believing his island couldn't survive alone, brought it into the federation of neighboring states that became Malaysia. But the Malay leadership asked Singapore to leave after two years because of ideological differences. Lee wept on national television while announcing the breakup, which he later would call one of his biggest political regrets. He then turned to governing his tiny island state, imposing strict policies that some saw as micromanaging the daily lives of Singaporeans. Lee outlawed the sale of chewing gum, promoted English and Mandarin while banning other Chinese dialects from public schools, radio and TV. He also enforced ethnic integration by controlling the makeup of public apartment buildings, where 80 percent of the population lives. Lee also cracked down on organized crime and imposed harsh penalties for minor infractions, a policy that has helped Singapore maintain one of the world's lowest violent crime rates. Drug couriers face mandatory hanging, vandals are sometimes caned - such as American teenager Michael Fay in 1994 despite a plea for leniency from President Bill Clinton - and litterbugs must pay a hefty fine.

{"raw_input": "Gareth Southgate is refusing to be carried away by his England Under-21 side after seeing them take another significant step forward with a victory over fellow European Championship finalists Germany. Southgate's youngsters twice came from behind at Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium before surging to a 3-2 win, to the delight of a crowd of 30,178. However, despite also beating Portugal and hosts the Czech Republic, who will also be at this summer's finals tournament, the former England defender is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. James Ward-Prowse wheels away in celebration after scoring the winner in England Under 21's win . Saints midfielder completed an unlikely comeback that saw two late goals scored in  three minutes . Asked if he was excited by what might lie ahead, Southgate said: 'Not really. 'I love working with the group that we have, staff and players, it's a real united body of people. We have got quality and they want to be the best they can be, so they have got a chance. 'But we also know that we are very quick to put people on a pedestal, and we haven't achieved anything yet. We have had some good results, we have had some nice compliments, but we know what our goal is and we know that we are driven to achieve that. 'We are not interested in too much until we do that.' Nathan Redmond leaps for joy after bringing England level at 2-2 with a deflected shot in the second half . Jesse Lindgard brought England level for the first time with a composed finish from Carl Jenkinson's cross . Southgate's caution was perhaps a reflection of an ordinary start by his team as they struggled to get to grips with a Germany squad boasting some 600 more top-flight appearances than his. England fell behind with just 15 minutes gone when Kaiserslautern striker Philipp Hofmann, celebrating his 22nd birthday, expertly controlled and converted a left-wing cross, and after Jesse Lingard had levelled, restored Germany's lead within five minutes of the restart. The home team left it late to make the big push, but when it came, it was decisive. Germany striker Philipp Hofmann scored a brace but could not prevent the Young Lions from securing win . Liverpool and Germany midfielderEmre Can (right) slides in for a tackle on England's Jake Forster-Caskey . Nathan Redmond's strike from substitute Alex Pritchard's pass levelled it with 10 minutes remaining, and it was left to skipper James Ward-Prowse to win it two minutes later when he accepted full-back Carl Jenkinson's ball and calmly steered his shot past keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Asked how he would manage expectation ahead of the summer, Southgate said: 'We will just show people the first 25 minutes of the game - that will keep everybody's expectations in check, it's as simple as that. 'We have belief in the group of players, and they are fantastic to work with. We believe they can play at a very high level, but we believe because of the talent and the ability that they have and the attitude that they have that we can keep pushing them. 'We have to keep pushing because the standard will go up again in the summer and everybody else will be more competitive again, and we have got to be the same.'

{"raw_input": "A whale that swam hundreds of miles up an African river after taking a wrong turn 17 million years ago is helping shed light on a key moment in human evolution. Palaeontologists discovered the fossilised remains of the ancient ancestor to modern beaked whales in the middle of one of the harshest desert areas of Turkana, Kenya. It has allowed scientists to pinpoint when the landscape in east Africa began to change as the land around the Great Rift Valley began to rise up. This 17 million-year-old fossil shown in the photograph above is from a whale found far inland in Kenya and has shed light on when east Africa's tectonic uplift that drastically altered the climate in the area first began . This was a crucial moment in human evolution from primates as it created the dry open habitats that led our ape-like ancestors to walk upright for the first time. They say that for the whale to have travelled so far inland in a river the area must have been much wetter, far flatter and dominated by forests. It is probably one of the most peculiar aspects of human biology - that females of a certain age lose the ability to reproduce. But scientists have discovered that killer whales - a species separated from humans by almost 94 million years of evolution - also suffer from the menopause. The finding could provide clues as to why the menopause evolved in the first place. The evolution of a trait that reduces the reproductive capability of a species has long baffled biologists and there are a number of theories for why it emerged in humans. Now a team of researchers from the University of Exeter and the University of York may have unraveled the reason for the menopause - in killer whales at least. They have found that it frees up the older, more experienced females to lead their families in the search for food and so boost the ability of the entire group to survive. The findings may now also help to explain why the menopause emerged in human populations - it allowed older women to impart their knowledge and help care for the younger members. Professor Louis Jacobs, a vertebrate palaeontologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas who led the study, said: 'The whale was stranded up river at a time when east Africa was at sea level and was covered with forest and jungle. 'As that part of the continent rose up, that caused the climate to become drier and drier. So over millions of years, forest gave way to grasslands. 'Primates evolved to adapt to grasslands and dry country. And that's when - in human evolution - the primates started to walk upright.' The whale fossil was first discovered in Loperot, west Turkana, Kenya in 1964 by palaeontologist James Mead, a curator at the Smithsonian Instution at the time. It was initially mistakenly identified as a turtle fossil but later identified as a whale in 1975. He named it Turkana ziphiid - a type of beaked whale that is related to modern marine mammals like the Baird and Cuvier's beaked whales - and estimated it had been 22ft (6.7 metres) long. Ziphiids are among the deepest diving mammals on the planet, plunging to nearly 10,000 feet (3,050 metres) in the ocean to feed on squid. The whale fossil was discovered nearly 459 miles (740km) inland and 2,000 feet (620 metres) above sea level. For it to have ended up there, the landscape at the time  must have looked very different. Palaeontologists found the remains of fish, crocodiles, turtles and mammals including primates, suggesting the area was dominated by a river and surrounded by a forest habitat. The fossil of the whale's beak (above), was found in 1964, and is thought to belong to an extinct species that became stranded in an ancient river after taking a wrong turn while swimming down the coast of east Africa . The fossil was found in an area of desert at Loperot in west Turkana, in Kenya, on the site of an ancient river . However, the whale fossil disappeared in 1979 and was only rediscovered in 2011 at Harvard University after Professor Jacobs asked curators to search for it. Professor Jacobs and his colleagues, whose work is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, have now re-examined the specimen and claim the whale has provided a definitive date for when the geological changes in East Africa began. Determining ancient land elevation is notoriously difficult, but the whale has provided new clues. The area of Turkana in Kenya where the fossil was found (above) is now a desert, but was a forest 17 million years ago when the whale is thought to have taken a wrong turn and swam hundreds of miles up a river . Professor Jacobs said for the whale to end up where it did, it must have swam far inland up the ancient Anza River with a low gradient ranging from 78 feet (24m) to 121 feet (37m) over 372 miles (600km) to 559 miles (900km). This suggests the landscape was very flat and close to sea level. Professor Jacobs and his colleagues believe the whale may have been migrating along the east African coast and mistakenly entered the mouth of the river. Once it began swimming up the river it could not change its course. James Mead shown above excavating the whale fossil in the 'Open Pit Turtle Mine' in Loperot, Kenya, in 1964 . The fossil was originally recorded as a large turtle in expedition log books but later it was found to be a whale. Scientists also discovered fossils of many other species including crocodiles and primates at the same site . There are some modern examples of whales making similar mistakes such as the sperm whale that swam up the Thames towards London, and other whales what have become stranded in the Sacramento River in California and the Amazon in Brazil. Professor Jacobs said: 'You don't usually find whales so far inland. Many of the known beaked whale fossils are dredged by fishermen from the bottom of the sea.' Estimates for exactly when human ancestors began walking on two feet instead of four are varied and controversial. Some claim that a six-million-year-old species called Sahelanthropus was the first to become bipedal while others point to the four-million-year-old Australopithecus anamensis. However, the latest study has now provided clues as to when the landscape in the part of Africa where these ancestors are thought to have taken their first bipedal steps began to change. Dr Henry Wichura, the lead author of the study an a palaeontologist at the University of Postdam in Germany, said: 'Surface uplift from near sea level coincides with paleoclimatic change from a humid environment to highly variable and much drier conditions, which altered biotic communities and drove evolution in east Africa, including that of primates.'

{"raw_input": "Children who spend a lot of time playing video games do better at school, an international study has suggested. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said there was strong evidence that playing computer games on handheld consoles like Nintendo DSs and Sony PSPs had 'positive effects on learning'.

The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said there was strong evidence that playing computer games had 'positive effects on learning' Girls are more likely to get higher marks at school because teachers like them more, an international report has found. Teachers consistently give better results to girls even when they perform similarly in international tests, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said. It suggests that teachers have a 'gender bias' towards girls because they are well behaved and listen in class. 'Girls' better marks may reflect the fact that they tend to be 'better students' than boys: they tend to do what is required and expected of them, thanks to better self-regulation skills, and they are more driven to excel in school,' the study says. But this may harm girls' future career prospects, the OECD suggests, because bosses  reward people based on what they  can do rather than their school grades. Students who play one-player video games between once a month and almost every day perform better in mathematics, reading, science and problem solving than students who hardly ever play games, the OECD said. But the evidence shows that playing computer games only helps children at school if they are not competing against other people over the internet. Boys are much more likely than girls to play computer games – but often get caught up in shoot 'em ups and other online competitions against other players, the study said. This means that playing on the computer at home helps girls more than boys. The report said: 'The gender gap in video gaming translates into a performance advantage for girls.' However, it also warns that the 'addictive nature of gaming' has its downsides. It said: 'Students who play video games excessively might not be able to focus on their work at school, may be less willing to spend time on school work at home, might develop sleep problems, and might be less perseverant if there are no immediate rewards for their efforts, like those offered in gaming.'

{"raw_input": "A woman found her fiancé on a Facebook selling page after he jokingly offered himself up for sale. Beckie Bennett, 43, was browsing her local buy and sell Facebook group when an unusual offer caught her eye - a local man had advertised himself as 'house trained' and up for sale. Richard Yardley, 38, had written the post as a joke. But when Beckie commented to check out the goods on offer, he asked her on a date. Beckie Bennett and Richard Yardley met after Richard jokingly advertised himself on a buy and sell Facebook page and Beckie commented on his picture. The pair are now engaged . Following their unusual introduction, the couple are now engaged after Richard proposed, and mother-of-three Beckie says she has bagged herself the best bargain ever - the man of her dreams. She said: 'We're going to tie the knot next August, and it's all thanks to that Facebook page. Richard is the best thing I've ever won on the buy, sell and swap page.' In May 2013, Beckie, of Harbury, near Leamington Spa, logged on to Facebook to search for furniture for her son's new flat. Cheeky blonde Richard had jokingly posted a picture of himself on to the page with the caption: 'man for sale - free to a good home.' Beckie said: 'I saw the picture of Richard with his glasses on and I decided to play along. 'I commented to check out Richard's credentials. It's the first rule of Facebook shopping - make sure what you're buying is up to scratch. ''Do you clean, wash and drive?' I asked. Within seconds he'd replied, 'all of the above.'' From the moment they met Beckie says she and Richard were inseparable, he has now proposed and they plan to get married later this year . Beckie and Richard enjoy a trip with two of her children Daniel 15 (left) and Phoebe, seven (centre) After the exchange Beckie was surprised to see that Richard had deleted the post from the Facebook page.

I commented first, so first dibs!' Richard popped the question by hiding the ring in his car and asking Beckie to fetch something out of his glove compartment. She said: 'He asked me to go fetch something from the car.. I went out thinking it would be some shopping. 'I ran back inside with the ring shouting 'yes' over and over again.

Following their unusual introduction, the couple are now engaged after Richard proposed, and mother-of-three Beckie says she has bagged herself the best bargain ever - the man of her dreams. She said: 'We're going to tie the knot next August, and it's all thanks to that Facebook page. Richard is the best thing I've ever won on the buy, sell and swap page.' In May 2013, Beckie, of Harbury, near Leamington Spa, logged on to Facebook to search for furniture for her son's new flat.

{"raw_input": "(CNN)The emissions sticker on David Kassick's car was expired. That's what first caught the attention of Lisa Mearkle, a police officer in Hummelstown Borough, Pennsylvania, who ordered Kassick, 59, to pull over on February 2. Instead, Kassick fled. Moments later, he lay dead on the ground in a yard near a relative's home. On Tuesday, Mearkle was arrested on a homicide charge following a state police investigation into the shooting. Mearkle's attorney, who described the use of deadly force in the case as justified, said he is girding his client for national scrutiny as the case finds itself on a growing list of officer-involved shootings. The final moments leading to Kassick's death were captured on video which Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Marsico Jr. said was critical in bringing the homicide charges. It was around 4 p.m. on February 2 when the 15-year police veteran first attempted to pull Kassick over, according to the charging documents. Instead of pulling over, Kassick took off and Mearkle gave chase, flipping on her lights and sirens. Less than a mile away, Kassick pulled into the driveway of a relative he'd been staying with and ran off on foot into the backyard, with Mearkle following close behind. As they ran through the yards behind Grandview Drive, the charging documents said, Mearkle fired her stun gun, automatically engaging a built-in audio and visual recording device. Marsico described the video: . \"She's running, she's tasing him, he falls to the ground. He's sort of writhing around on the ground a little bit,\" Marsico said. Standing several feet behind his prone body, Mearkle shouts for Kassick to show his hands. Despite the commands, Marsico said there were multiple points in the videos where Kassick is seen reaching beneath himself, his hands obscured to Mearkle. Holding the Taser in her left hand, court documents said, Mearkle drew her gun in her right hand and, while continuing to shout \"show me your hands,\" fired twice into Kassick's back. Kassick was pronounced dead at the scene. He was unarmed. Marsico said the video was critical in determining the first criminal charges brought against a police officer in a shooting like this in his 15 years as district attorney. \"He was face down on the ground, no weapon had been displayed. He didn't approach her, he didn't come toward her, he didn't verbally threaten her in any way,\" Marsico said of Kassick. \"It's our position that her use of deadly force was not necessary.\" CNN has filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain the video, which it has not independently viewed. Mearkle later told investigators she thought Kassick had been reaching into his jacket for a gun, according to court documents. \"What was she supposed to do?\" Mearkle's attorney, Brian Perry said. \"She felt that this was the only option that she had.\" \"Keep in mind she had tased this individual four times and was screaming commands to him and he kept reaching under,\" Perry said. Mearkle was placed on electronic monitoring on Tuesday after posting $250,000 bail. \"This was an extremely difficult case for all involved but in the end, we are servants of Justice and must now allow the judicial process to conduct a fair and impartial review of the allegations that have been presented,\" the Borough of Hummelstown said in a statement. Hummelstown Borough announced on Wednesday that Mearkle had been suspended from the Police Department without pay.", "raw_output": "Police Officer Lisa Mearkle faces homicide charge for shooting an unarmed man .\nDavid Kassick, 59, was shot and killed after fleeing a traffic stop .", "trunc_input": "(CNN)The emissions sticker on David Kassick's car was expired.

As they ran through the yards behind Grandview Drive, the charging documents said, Mearkle fired her stun gun, automatically engaging a built-in audio and visual recording device. Marsico described the video: . \"She's running, she's tasing him, he falls to the ground. He's sort of writhing around on the ground a little bit,\" Marsico said. Standing several feet behind his prone body, Mearkle shouts for Kassick to show his hands. Despite the commands, Marsico said there were multiple points in the videos where Kassick is seen reaching beneath himself, his hands obscured to Mearkle. Holding the Taser in her left hand, court documents said, Mearkle drew her gun in her right hand and, while continuing to shout \"show me your hands,\" fired twice into Kassick's back. Kassick was pronounced dead at the scene. He was unarmed. Marsico said the video was critical in determining the first criminal charges brought against a police officer in a shooting like this in his 15 years as district attorney. \"He was face down on the ground, no weapon had been displayed. He didn't approach her, he didn't come toward her, he didn't verbally threaten her in any way,\" Marsico said of Kassick. \"It's our position that her use of deadly force was not necessary.\" CNN has filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain the video, which it has not independently viewed. Mearkle later told investigators she thought Kassick had been reaching into his jacket for a gun, according to court documents. \"What was she supposed to do?\" Mearkle's attorney, Brian Perry said. \"She felt that this was the only option that she had.\" \"Keep in mind she had tased this individual four times and was screaming commands to him and he kept reaching under,\" Perry said. Mearkle was placed on electronic monitoring on Tuesday after posting $250,000 bail. \"This was an extremely difficult case for all involved but in the end, we are servants of Justice and must now allow the judicial process to conduct a fair and impartial review of the allegations that have been presented,\" the Borough of Hummelstown said in a statement. Hummelstown Borough announced on Wednesday that Mearkle had been suspended from the Police Department without pay.", "trunc_output": "Police Officer Lisa Mearkle faces homicide charge for shooting an

{"raw_input": "(CNN)The cost of college has rapidly increased over the past 30 years. Students today face annual costs, between tuition and living, that can easily exceed $10,000 at a community college, $18,000 at a public four-year college (in-state), and $40,000 at a private four-year school. It's unsurprising that today's students often graduate with large debt loads. More than two-thirds of students graduate with debt. And the average amount of debt owed is about $30,000. Given the cost of college, students and families need to know that they're making a good investment. That's why we need to move to a system where we measure learning outcomes, not just time spent in a classroom accumulating credits. A college degree is the only sure path to middle-class security, and because young people and their parents know that, the cost of college, and the availability of loans and other aid, has become a powerful political issue. But for all the attention paid to the price of college, we haven't given enough thought to whether students and their families are getting their money's worth. Is American higher education worth the price? Are students and their families getting what they're paying for? There's plenty of evidence that for many of them, the answer is no. In 2006, a government study found that nearly 70% of college graduates could not perform basic tasks like comparing opposing editorials. In a 2011 book, \"Academically Adrift,\" researchers studied 2,000 students at two dozen universities over four years and found that 45% of them showed no significant gains on a test of critical thinking, complex reasoning, and communication skills after two years of college. Even at the end of four years, 36% of the students hadn't gained those skills. Given the evidence, maybe it's not a surprise that employers aren't impressed by recent college graduates. Employers want the skills that higher education says it provides to students: the ability to critically think, communicate, work in a team, write effectively, and adapt. Yet only about one-quarter of employers say that colleges and universities are doing a good job in preparing students effectively for the challenges of today's global economy. A recent Gallup poll found that only 11% of business leaders strongly agreed that college graduates have the skills necessary to succeed on the job. In addition to money, these graduates have spent hours and hours in classrooms and taking tests, but the time doesn't seem to have translated into learning. Why is this? Perhaps it's as simple as this: We measure education in terms of time, rather than learning. A four-year degree attests that you have acquired 120 credits. That's an accidental result of the credit hour system, which was created by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie more than 100 years ago, for the purpose of providing struggling professors with pensions. At the turn of the 20th century, Carnegie created a $10 million free pension fund to help professors retire. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, which was set up to administer the fund, determined that only \"full-time\" faculty would qualify for pensions, which they defined as teaching 12 \"credit units,\" with each unit equal to one hour of faculty-student contact time per week, over a 15-week semester. While originally a narrow measure of faculty workload, the credit hour quickly morphed into much more. The Carnegie Foundation warned against using the credit hour as a proxy for student learning, but the temptation of an easy-to-understand and seemingly standardized measure was too great to resist. It just made organizing the whole higher education enterprise much easier. If credit hours truly reflected a standardized unit of learning, they would be fully transferable across institutions. An hour in Arizona is an hour in New York. But colleges routinely reject credits earned at other colleges, suggesting that even though they use credit hours themselves, they know they are not a reliable measure of how much students have learned.  Many students, however, believe the fiction that the credit hour is a standardized currency and assume that credits will transfer from one school to the next. This is an unfortunate and costly assumption, as community college students in Louisiana will tell you. Until recently, Louisiana students with an associate degree typically lost between 21 and 24 credits when transferring to a four-year state school. That's a year of time and money lost. Given that nearly 60% of students in the United States attend two or more colleges, the nontransfer of credits has huge costs, not only to individuals, but also to the federal government and states that are financing this duplicative classroom time. If higher education doesn't trust its own credits, why should anyone else? And Louisiana students aren't alone; transfer students across the country lose credits, which lengthens their time to get a degree. So we have two problems: Students who have earned credits -- at great expense in time and money-- can't use or transfer them. Others who have accumulated costly credits haven't learned much. And then there's a third dimension: Millions of people who have learned a great deal have no \"credit\" because they learned it at the wrong place — that is to say, not at a \"college.\" Someone who has spent the last 10 years working as a nurse's aid in a hospital who decides to go get a nursing degree has to start from scratch, taking introductory courses he could probably teach, because colleges treat those without credits as blank slates. Employees at a biotech company with a high-quality on-the-job training program might learn more than someone in a two-year college science program, but unless this training is attached to an accredited institution of higher learning, the learning won't \"count.\" For the millions of adult workers looking to retrain and reskill, the focus on time rather than learning, especially when between family and work, their time is scarce, is a daunting proposition. State and federal governments add to the problem, because while they spend hundreds of billions on higher education each year, most of it is for time served, in the form of credit hours, rather than learning achieved. We need to stop counting time and start counting learning. What could that look like? We don't have to wonder; some schools are experimenting with measuring learning rather than time—some for decades. One relatively new program is Southern New Hampshire University's College for America, or CfA, an online \"competency-based\" Associate of Arts degree aimed at working adults. The program has no courses, no credit hours and no grades. The school has broken down what students with a degree from CfA should know and be able to do, what it calls competencies. CfA worked closely with employers to identify the competencies employers were looking for, like communication, critical thinking and teamwork. Then faculty designed real-world tasks and projects to determine whether students had mastered each competency. Unlike in credit-hour courses, CfA has no seat-time requirements. Students can move through the program as quickly as they can demonstrate mastery of the competencies. Someone who worked at a PR firm might whiz through the communications competencies and spend more time on the math competencies. And the faster students can progress, the less they will ultimately pay. Students pay $1,250 for all-they-can-learn in six months. This means they can spend their precious time and money learning what they don't already know, rather than wasting it on what they already do. Students at CfA can be confident that their time and money are well spent and, at the end, they will have a very clear picture of what they know and can do. CfA is not the only one to offer this to students, nor the only model. Hundreds of schools, from Antioch to the University of Michigan to Purdue University, are looking to offer competency-based certificate, associate, and baccalaureate degree programs.  How are universities staying afloat financially with such low tuition? In many cases, the answer is surprisingly simple—and, sadly, not commonplace in higher education—by focusing on what students need in order to, wait for it, learn. Fancy amenities, great football teams and sprawling college campuses may bring attention, but they have little to nothing to do with student learning. Some competency-based programs don't focus on research -- faculty are hired for specific expertise, like curriculum design, English literature or advising. Other programs use technology and data analytics to help students and faculty understand where students are doing well and where they are struggling. This allows for more targeted, personalized support by faculty. There is, however, a downside for students: Self-paced competency-based programs do not fit in neatly with the historically time-based credit hour, making it difficult for students in these types of programs to receive state and federal support. Without access to these dollars, the programs will remain one-offs and unavailable to the majority of Americans who could use them. Only recently has the federal government recognized the role it could play in encouraging the move from seat time to learning by redirecting some of its nearly $150 billion-plus financial aid budget. The U.S. Department of Education is encouraging innovation by colleges looking to experiment with alternatives to the credit hour, and there is strong bipartisan interest in both the House and Senate to explore innovative ways of paying for learning, rather than time. As higher education becomes increasingly necessary and expensive, measuring time rather than learning is a luxury that students, taxpayers and the nation can no longer afford. Paying for what students learn and can do, rather than how or where they spent their time, would go a long way toward providing students and the nation with desperately needed, high-quality degrees and credentials.", "raw_output": "Is American higher education worth the price?

{"raw_input": "This is the dramatic moment a brave cyclist chased down three thieves who had just stolen another rider's bike. Alex Sweeting, 25, was riding along the road in Leyton, east London, when he saw a 53-year-old man in cycling gear who had just been shoulder barged off his bike. Mr Sweeting's head camera shows him pedalling madly after the three men at 21mph - as the heart rate monitor he was also wearing reached 164 beats per minute. Scroll down for video . This is the dramatic moment brave cyclist Alex Sweeting chased down three thieves who had just stolen another rider's bike, as the heart rate monitor he was wearing showed his pulse was beating at 164bpm . Keen cyclist Mr Sweeting (pictured), 25, pedalled after the thieves and managed to retrieve the stolen bike . As he shouted at the men, they dropped the bike and sprinted away. Mr Sweeting, a technical production manager at Teradata, told MailOnline: 'It was 10.30pm at night and I had been at work and then at my cycling club (Lea Valley Cycling Club) social at a pub that we have once a month. 'I was cycling home with a mate when we went our separate ways. I was riding home to Barking and I was going quite quickly. 'I then saw a guy running along in cycling shoes, which I thought was a bit odd. 'He flagged me and a bus down and said what had happened and that someone had nicked his bike and I then saw them running off in the distance.' The helmet mounted camera belonging to rider Alex Sweeting, 25, shows the 53-year-old man in cycling gear running along the cycling lane after three thieves pushed him to the ground and stole his bike . With his helmet-mounted camera and heart monitor on, Mr Sweeting raced after the three thieves in Leyton . He added: 'I wasn't thinking much at the time. I just thought \"how can I get near them\"? 'It was only when I stopped that I realised what I'd done. 'The cyclist then caught back up with me and he was already on the phone to the police. He was obviously really annoyed about what happened, but was glad he got his bike back. He said the bike only cost about £200. 'He was very grateful but said it wasn't the first time it has happened to him in the same area.' Mr Sweeting, a passionate cyclist who travels by bike to work every day, added: 'It angers me that people do this. It could have happened to anyone. You should be able to feel safe on a bike wherever you go, but this was a vicious attack. Pedalling at a top speed of 21mph and with his heart rate at 164 bpm, Mr Sweeting caught up with the thugs . As his speeds ticks over 20mph, Mr Sweeting frantically pedals after the three thieves in the distance . 'I actually got the helmet camera for Christmas because of an incident with a car, so I'm really glad I got it. Hopefully it'll lead to some sort of prosecution or charge.' A police spokesman said the victim - who was making his way towards Wanis Distribution Centre in Orient Way, Leyton - was slightly injured but declined medical attention. Police described how one of the men suddenly charged at the cyclist, causing him to fall off his bike into the road. Another man then punched the victim in the back of the head before a third grabbed the bike and all three ran off. The three men were described as being between 18 and 25 and about 5ft 8ins tall. Two were described as black, while the other appeared to be Asian. Mr Sweeting caught up with the three men on his bike and they dropped the stolen bike before running off . The three thieves discarded the stolen bike as Mr Sweeting caught up with them and then fled on foot . As Mr Sweeting retrieved the stolen bicycle, the three men continued to run away along the track in Leyton . Officers searched the area but the men had escaped. Last month, Alan Cartwright, 15, died after he was stabbed while riding his bike in Islington, North London. The two friends he was with had their bikes stolen during the attack.

Mr Sweeting's head camera shows him pedalling madly after the three men at 21mph - as the heart rate monitor he was also wearing reached 164 beats per minute. Scroll down for video . This is the dramatic moment brave cyclist Alex Sweeting chased down three thieves who had just stolen another rider's bike, as the heart rate monitor he was wearing showed his pulse was beating at 164bpm . Keen cyclist Mr Sweeting (pictured), 25, pedalled after the thieves and managed to retrieve the stolen bike . As he shouted at the men, they dropped the bike and sprinted away. Mr Sweeting, a technical production manager at Teradata, told MailOnline: 'It was 10.30pm at night and I had been at work and then at my cycling club (Lea Valley Cycling Club) social at a pub that we have once a month. 'I was cycling home with a mate when we went our separate ways. I was riding home to Barking and I was going quite quickly. 'I then saw a guy running along in cycling shoes, which I thought was a bit odd. 'He flagged me and a bus down and said what had happened and that someone had nicked his bike and I then saw them running off in the distance.' The helmet mounted camera belonging to rider Alex Sweeting, 25, shows the 53-year-old man in cycling gear running along the cycling lane after three thieves pushed him to the ground and stole his bike . With his helmet-mounted camera and heart monitor on, Mr Sweeting raced after the three thieves in Leyton . He added: 'I wasn't thinking much at the time. I just thought \"how can I get near them\"? 'It was only when I stopped that I realised what I'd done. 'The cyclist then caught back up with me and he was already on the phone to the police. He was obviously really annoyed about what happened, but was glad he got his bike back. He said the bike only cost about £200. 'He was very grateful but said it wasn't the first time it has happened to him in the same area.' Mr Sweeting, a passionate cyclist who travels by bike to work every day, added: 'It angers me that people do this. It could have happened to anyone. You should be able to feel safe on a bike wherever you go, but this was a vicious attack. Pedalling at a top speed of 21mph and with his heart rate at 164 bpm, Mr Sweeting caught up with the thugs . As his speeds ticks over 20mph, Mr Sweeting frantically pedals after the three thieves in the distance . 'I actually got the helmet camera for Christmas because of an incident with a car, so I'm really glad I got it. Hopefully it'll lead to some sort of prosecution or charge.' A police spokesman said the victim - who was making his way towards Wanis Distribution Centre in Orient Way, Leyton - was slightly injured but declined medical attention. Police described how one of the men suddenly charged at the cyclist, causing him to fall off his bike into the road. Another man then punched the victim in the back of the head before a third grabbed the bike and all three ran off. The three men were described as being between 18 and 25 and about 5ft 8ins tall. Two were described as black, while the other appeared to be Asian. Mr Sweeting caught up with the three men on his bike and they dropped the stolen bike before running off . The three thieves discarded the stolen bike as Mr Sweeting caught up with them and then fled on foot . As Mr Sweeting retrieved the stolen bicycle, the three men continued to run away along the track in Leyton . Officers searched the area but the men had escaped. Last month, Alan Cartwright, 15, died after he was stabbed while riding his bike in Islington, North London. The two friends he was with had their bikes stolen during the attack.

{"raw_input": "The last ever professional photos of Marilyn Monroe taken just weeks before her untimely death have emerged for sale for a staggering $36,000. The six poignant pictures of the screen siren were taken by close friend George Barris on July 13, 1962, destined for a book about Monroe. Just three weeks later Monroe was found dead - making Barris's pictures of the world's biggest star hugely valuable. Yet New York native Barris was devastated by the loss of his friend, and scrapped plans for the book. He also refused to allow the images, the last professional shots ever to be taken of Monroe, to be published for several years afterwards. The last kiss: This appears to be the final picture taken by a professional photographer of Marilyn Monroe, shot by close friend George Barris on a beach in Santa Monica on July 13, 1962 . Collectibles: This collection of six pictures by Barris are going up for auction next week . Comfortable: The two had become good friends - which shows clearly in the relaxed shots taken by Barris . The set of six original prints have now come up for sale, and experts are predicting they could fetch as much as $6,000 each - around £4,000. The intimate shots appear to show just how comfortable Monroe was with her friend of seven years. Barris had first met Monroe on the set of her film The Seven Year Itch in 1954. 'When I first saw her I thought she was the most beautiful, fantastic person I'd ever met,' Barris told the Los Angeles Daily News in 2012, ahead of an exhibition to mark what would have been the film star's 86th birthday. 'She completely knocked me off my feet.' The two remained firm friend. Barris told the Huffington Post: 'What I particularly liked about Marilyn was that she didn't act like a movie star. 'I was most impressed that Marilyn was always polite and friendly to everyone on the set. She was no phony or snob.' Barris revealed to the Daily News that the final shot he ever took of Monroe was on the beach, wrapped in a blanket. 'She puckered up and said, `This is just for you, George,' and blew a kiss to me. That's the last picture I took of her,' he said. A print of that picture among the six on sale, along with a two more from the beach in Santa Monica, while two are taken inside a house in Hollywood. Compilation: Barris had planned to include the pictures in a book about Monroe he was putting together . Grief: But Barris scrapped plans for the book, and refused to publish the pictures for years after her death . Devastated: After her death, Barris moved to Paris, where he lived for the next 20 years . Memories: Barris finally published the book, which he started working on in 1962, in 2012 . Also on sale are six signed shots from the iconic photoshoot of Monroe taken by fellow photographer Bert Stern in late June 1962 for Vogue magazine. Stern's images would become known as 'The Last Sitting' - despite Barris's pictures being taken later on. The black and white Stern shots, which include one of a sultry Monroe naked on a bed, are also expected to make anything between $3,500 and $8,000 each (about £2,300 to £5,200). Both collections are being sold by Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, on behalf of two private collectors. Iconic: Six pictures for Bert Stern's Last Sitting collection for Vogue are also on sale at auction . Stunning: This particular print - signed by photographer Stern - is expected to fetch $8,000 . Ironic: Stern's pictures became known as The Last Sitting, despite Monroe posing for Barris later . Rachel Peart, director of photographs at Heritage New York, said: 'Bert Stern did a shoot with Marilyn Monroe for Vogue magazine in June 1962 which everyone refers to as 'The Last Sitting' - her last ever studio photos. 'The images he took became very iconic. Marilyn was the biggest star in the world at the time and Stern's photos were very glamorous. 'What is less well known is that another photographer, George Barris, took a series of intimate pictures of Marilyn a few weeks after Bert Stern's shoot - so those are technically the last ever studio shots of her.' Glamorous: This photograph - titled Feeling Good - is expected to make as much as $3,500 . Legendary: The Stern shots form an important part of the Monroe tale and are likely to be highly sought after . Sale: The auction of prints like this one, signed by Stern, takes place between March 10 and March 15 . Pearl added: 'All the pictures we are selling are authentic, genuine prints made by and signed by the photographers, many within five years of the originals being taken. 'Marilyn Monroe transcends generations and appeals to a wide range of collectors. She is timeless and market for Marilyn memorabilia is very strong. 'Because Marilyn was so iconic a lot of people took photos of her, however these photos are among the best and most rare out there.'

{"raw_input": "Seth Lane has made a heartbreaking plea for people to wear yellow to support him as he waits for a bone marrow transplant, confined to his hospital bed . Five-year-old Seth Lane has one wish - for the world to wear his favourite colour, yellow. The brave youngster lives in a 'bubble' and can only dream of life outside the confines of his hospital room. He is bound to his bed by a rare immune disorder, which has made the outside, germ-infested world his enemy. Seth was born without an immune system and has lived in a sterile environment for more than half of his short life. Following an unsuccessful bone marrow transplant, his immune system turned on him once again. Since January the five-year-old has been forced to live in his hospital room. As he waits for a life-changing second bone marrow transplant Seth has made a heartbreaking video, watched by more than two million people, in which he appeals for people to show their support. Using speech boards the adorable youngster asks people to wear yellow on March 27, and post a picture on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram with the hashtag #WearyellowforSeth. Seth's parents, Leanne and Nik Lane, from Corby in Northamptonshire, said they have been astonished when the video went viral, with more than 2.5 million views in a matter of days. Hundreds of thousands of strangers have already pledged to wear yellow to show Seth they are thinking of him. The video features a smiling Seth perched on his bed holding up yellow cards asking for support. He said: 'Hello I'm Seth. I'm five-years-old and I love Fireman Sam, Paw Patrol and yellow. 'I'm in hospital, I was born with no immune system, and I need a second bone marrow transplant. 'On March 27 lots of people are going to wear yellow to show me how much support I have. Are you going to join in? 'Post a picture of you wearing yellow to Facebook, Twitter or Instagram with #wearyellowforseth.' Mrs Lane, a full-time mother-of-two, said: 'We never meant to start any sort of campaign, and only expected friends and family to join in. 'I can't believe it has taken off like this. It is overwhelming. Scroll down for video . The five-year-old was born without an immune system, leaving him vulnerable to picking up life-threatening infections. The condition, known as 'bubble disease' requires sufferers to live in a sterile 'bubble' 'I don't think there is a single country in the world that hasn't got someone who has got involved. 'It all helps show Seth that people are thinking of him. I told him about the views and he asked, \"Is it more than 20?' I said \"yes it is\" and he said \"wowee\".' Seth was admitted to hospital at the age of six months with an extreme chest infection. His parents were told he had severe combined immunodeficiency. Known as 'bubble boy disease' it is caused by a mutated gene and means the body's antibodies cannot respond to infections, leaving sufferers extremely vulnerable to germs. He was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital where he had a bone marrow transplant from donor umbilical cord cells. But he was kept in a 'bubble' - unable to interact with children, go to nursery or play outside in parks - for two years while his body got stronger. Mrs Lane, who has a five-month-old son Hugo with her husband, Nik, 31, said: 'He had no contact with other children until he was two-and-a-half. 'We would go out in the pram and I would have to put the rain cover over him with a little fan inside - people probably thought I was mad.' But after just a couple of years of normality - after Seth had started school and made his first best friends - his body turned on him in October. When he had his transplant as a baby he developed graft versus host disease - where his donated cells saw his own body cells as foreign and attacked them. A first bone marrow transplant failed, when his immune system turned on him. It means Seth is now confined to his hospital room once more, waiting for a second transplant . His father Nik Lane is set to be Seth's donor, and doctors are waiting until the five-year-old is well enough before performing the operation . Seth's parents recorded an adorable video of him holding up screen cards, appealing for people to wear his favourite colour, yellow, to show their support. It has so far been viewed by more than two million people . Initially, it only affected his skin - leaving him with painful red patches - but in October it turned on his own bone marrow, once again wiping out his entire immune system. Seth returned to his 'bubble' - an ultra-hygienic single room at Newcastle's Great North Children's Hospital - in a bid to keep him free from potentially lethal infections, in January. 'If I'm a bit run down and have a coldsore I can't touch him,' said Mrs Lane. 'And if we have a cold we can't go in at all. 'Everything has to be sterilised and his room has filtered air. The staff are scrupulous with cleaning. 'Nothing can leave the room once it has come in and been cleaned, his soft toys are washed at 60 degrees every couple of days and his bed sheets are boil washed every day. 'Nik is with him all the time so his clothes have to be washed at 60 every day and Seth has never been out the room.' His father - who will be a donor for Seth once he is well enough - recorded the video of Seth last week. In just six days it has attracted 2,483,855 views and hundreds of thousands of people have messaged Mrs Lane to say they are planning on wearing yellow. It is thought Seth will have his transplant in around six weeks, but will probably have to remain in near-isolation for around a year after the operation. 'It's hard for him, and he is getting bored, but he never complains and he understands,' said Mrs Lane. After his operation and around a year in a sterile environment, Seth's parents hope he will be able to play with his friends and little brother again .", "raw_output": "Seth Lane, five, from Corby, was born without an immune system .\nHis severe combined immunodeficiency leaves him vulnerable to infection .\nHas been forced to live in a sterile environment for more than half his life .\nFirst bone marrow transplant failed, and his immune system turned on him .\nHe is now confined to his hospital bed waiting for second transplant .\nFather Nik will be Seth's donor when he is well enough for the operation .\nSeth has made a heartbreaking video asking people to show their support .\nOn March 27 he's asking people to #WearyellowforSeth and post pictures .", "trunc_input": "Seth Lane has made a heartbreaking plea for people to wear yellow to support him as he waits for a bone marrow transplant, confined to his hospital bed .

{"raw_input": "George North has been warned he could put his career in jeopardy if he plays again this season after suffering a third confirmed concussion in the space of four months. The Northampton and Wales winger, who sustained two head injuries against England in February but was controversially allowed to play on after medics missed the incidents, was knocked unconscious again on Friday night in Saints' Aviva Premiership win over Wasps. Northampton director of rugby Jim Mallinder indicated after the game that the 22-year-old could still be considered for next Saturday's European Champions Cup clash with Clermont, but brain injury experts insist he should not play again this season. 'George needs to be given an extended rest period to figure out if this is something that he has just not recovered from or whether there are genuine issues,' World Rugby concussion advisor Professor Willie Stewart said. George North was knocked out after colliding with Nathan Hughes' knee during the win over Wasps on Friday . 'I think he personally needs to say, 'No, I'm not playing again this season'. If he does play again too soon it could be the end of his World Cup or even his career. 'The people looking after him, including Northampton and the Welsh Rugby Union, should be recommending some time out and the experts he is seeing should recommend some time out. 'No-one should be talking about playing him next week. That's just ridiculous. I know at this time of year we're getting into the thick of it for trophies and championships but it's also getting into the sharp end for George's brain.

North was immediately knocked unconscious following the contact during Northampton's win over Wasps . The Northampton and Wales winger is treated by medical staff before leaving the field on a stretcher . North missed Wales' win over South Africa last autumn after being concussed against New Zealand and was given three weeks off in February after the outcry over the way his double head knock against England was handled. A Northampton statement read: 'After the game George North was conscious and in the Saints' changing room with the rest of the team. He has been into the club for treatment and will continue to be monitored by the Saints' experienced medical team throughout the weekend. 'As with everyone in the squad, Northampton Saints places the highest importance on player welfare, and as such North will see a specialist early next week for an assessment.' England full back Mike Brown, rested for a month during the Six Nations after being knocked out against Italy on February 14, missed Harlequins' Wembley clash with Saracens after experiencing further concussion-related symptoms in recent days. Earlier this week former Wales international Jonathan Davies said he feared for Leigh Halfpenny's career if the full back did not improve a tackling technique that contributed to him being concussed in his side's final Six Nations win over Italy. The North and Brown cases have again raised questions over rugby's return-to-play protocols, which can permit concussed players to play again within six days if they are shown to be symptom free. In professional boxing, a sport with a concussion rate comparable to professional rugby's, any fighter who loses consciousness for less than a minute faces a mandatory 90 day stand down. A loss of consciousness of more than a minute leads to an enforced 180 day rest period. North was also knocked out twice during Wales' Six Nations defeat by England earlier this year .

The Northampton and Wales winger, who sustained two head injuries against England in February but was controversially allowed to play on after medics missed the incidents, was knocked unconscious again on Friday night in Saints' Aviva Premiership win over Wasps. Northampton director of rugby Jim Mallinder indicated after the game that the 22-year-old could still be considered for next Saturday's European Champions Cup clash with Clermont, but brain injury experts insist he should not play again this season. 'George needs to be given an extended rest period to figure out if this is something that he has just not recovered from or whether there are genuine issues,' World Rugby concussion advisor Professor Willie Stewart said. George North was knocked out after colliding with Nathan Hughes' knee during the win over Wasps on Friday . 'I think he personally needs to say, 'No, I'm not playing again this season'. If he does play again too soon it could be the end of his World Cup or even his career. 'The people looking after him, including Northampton and the Welsh Rugby Union, should be recommending some time out and the experts he is seeing should recommend some time out.

{"raw_input": "(CNN)A manager at an Indiana Veterans Hospital has been placed on paid administrative leave after sending a \"completely and totally unacceptable\" email apparently mocking mental illness. The email, sent by Robin Paul, \"in no way reflects the attitudes of our staff toward our patients,\" Roudebush VA Medical Center Director Tom Mattice said in a statement posted on the hospital's Facebook page. Paul, a licensed clinical social worker, had been managing the Seamless Transition Integrated Care Clinic, which is responsible for assisting new veterans with their VA benefits, services and programs, to include mental health, according to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Her email, first published by the Indy Star this week, was sent December 18 to members of her team and shows four photos of an elf in different scenarios.  Two of the photos have struck a nerve with the veterans and mental illness communities. In one photograph, the elf appears leaning over what looks like a straw and coffee grounds on a paper plate, with a post-it note that says, \"Out of XANAX - Please help!\" The caption reads, \"Self-medicating for mental health issues when a CNS would not give him his requested script.\" In another, the elf is hanging from a string of Christmas lights. \"Caught in the act of suicidal behavior (trying to hang himself from an electrical cord),\" the caption says. John Thomas is a veteran of the Korean and Vietnam Wars and serves as a leader at an Indianapolis American Legion post. He said the email makes him sick and angry. \"I can't understand anybody who would do anything like this to us,\" Thomas told CNN affiliate WISH. Hospital leadership was allegedly made aware of the email a couple of months ago, according to the Indy Star, and had \"administratively addressed\" the incident with Paul. But since the story went viral, the Roudebush VA Facebook page has been inundated with commenters calling for Paul to be fired. Matthew Conrad on Facebook said, \"Robin Paul's continued employment is an insult to every Veteran who has served this country.\" Mattice announced Paul's leave, and a pending investigation, Tuesday evening.  But many say it's not enough. \"FIRING her would be the first step in showing you are truly committed to the veterans' health and well-being. Action speaks louder than words,\" Elizabeth Sanchez wrote on Facebook. Two of the country's largest veterans organizations have also criticized Paul's actions. \"It is absolutely inexcusable that a VA supervisor would make light of any issue that veterans face,\"  VFW National Commander John W. Stroud said in a statement. \"The VFW demands she be replaced as program manager.\" The American Legion also expressed their discontent, saying they take \"health care for veterans very seriously.\" \"Veterans suffering from TBI and PTSD should not be held up to ridicule,\" their statement read. John Crimmins was one of a few who came to the hospital's defense. \"As a veteran who receives care at the Rodebush VA Medical Center, I find this apology to be acceptable. We're all prone to doing stupid things. I'm sure Ms. Paul has received a reprimand for her actions. She doesn't need to lose her job. Now, let's move on,\" he wrote on the VA's Facebook page. Mattice, who was not available for comment Wednesday, did not elaborate on the investigation into the incident, or why it took so long to move forward with placing Paul on leave, but instead asked for forgiveness. \"I ask veterans to accept my apology for this failure, and to allow us to continue to demonstrate to you our commitment to your health and well-being,\" he said. This incident is the latest in what has been a tumultuous year for the Veterans Affairs Department.

{"raw_input": "(CNN)In the past eight months, ISIS has seeded itself in some dozen countries around the globe. Indicative of this was the announcement on Saturday that the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram had pledged its \"allegiance to the Caliph of the Muslims,\" ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. The global spread of ISIS raises key questions about whether these new affiliates signal an intensification of the threat of terror. It also has important implications for the debate in Congress over Obama's request for a new authorization to fight ISIS. Lt. Col. Michael Waltz, a U.S. Special Forces reserve officer who has just returned to the States after advising the Nigerian Ministry of Defence in its fight against Boko Haram, told me, \"So far the pledge (to ISIS) seems to be legit.\" Waltz says there is some debate about the timing of the pledge, because Boko Haram has recently come under effective attacks by Nigerian forces allied with the armies of neighboring African countries that are also threatened by the group: \"Some folks in the region are saying it's a sign of desperation, as the regional offensive by Nigeria and its neighbors has knocked Boko Haram on its heels and out of a number of its sanctuaries. The Chadians have been particularly effective.\" But Waltz also says there is some evidence that the Boko Haram pledge to ISIS \"has been in the works for some time.\" The group's increasing alignment with ISIS is demonstrated by Boko Haram's recent beheadings of its victims and its more professionally edited video releases of recent weeks that have mimicked ISIS' slick videos. Virginia Comolli, whose book \"Boko Haram: Nigeria's Islamist Insurgency,\" will be published next month, agrees that the more sophisticated Boko Haram media releases of the past couple of months point to \"some sort of inspiration\" that Boko Haram is drawing from ISIS and that recent beheadings \"might also be a form of copycat but, I shall note, they are not completely new\" for Boko Haram. Comolli also emphasized to me, \"lately the government had been able to take back a number of towns under Boko Haram control. Boko Haram has always been very resilient and adaptable, changing and upping its game when needed. The pledge might be exactly that: Boko Haram has recently suffered some serious blows and feels it needs to try something different to strengthen its position.\" Some 5,000 have died in Boko-related violence during the past half-decade, while more than 1.5 million have been forced out of their homes, but Boko has generally not attacked Western targets. Its affiliation with ISIS could change that although, for the moment, it's not clear how the Boko-ISIS alliance would work from an operational standpoint. Hilary Matfess, a researcher at the Nigeria Social Violence Project at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, told me, \"Boko Haram would be the largest group to pledge allegiance to ISIS, but it's not certain what kinds of logistical or operational support that ISIS could provide an African affiliate.\" Since August, Boko Haram is one of some 30 terrorist groups that have issued statements of support for ISIS or have gone further and pledged their allegiance to ISIS, according to IntelCenter, a Virginia-based company that tracks terrorist organizations. Of most concern are the groups that have pledged allegiance to ISIS, since this allows ISIS some measure of command and control over these organizations and also means that these groups will likely more closely align with ISIS' goal of creating a caliphate across the Muslim world as soon as feasible and use the most reprehensible of tactics to do so. In addition to Boko Haram, terrorist groups in Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Yemen have pledged allegiance to ISIS, according to IntelCenter. What could this mean for the wider jihadist terrorist movement? It's worth taking a closer look at how the Libyan branch of ISIS, which affiliated with it in November, has played out on the ground in Libya. A senior U.S. government official told me that there is some debate in the U.S. intelligence community about whether ISIS' Libyan affiliate is more of a \"wannabe\" ISIS, and a \"rebranding\" of a local group that wanted to take advantage of ISIS' fearsome brand, than a group that takes orders from ISIS central command in Syria and Iraq. On January 27, ISIS gunmen attacked the Corinthian Hotel in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, killing 10. Five of the victims were foreigners and one was an American. And last month ISIS released a video showing members of Egypt's Coptic Christian minority being beheaded on a Libyan beach, apparently by members of ISIS' Libyan affiliate. The video showed the victims in the orange jumpsuits that ISIS forces its victims to wear. Both the attack on the Corinthian Hotel and the beheading of the Christians do suggest some measure of command and control by ISIS' core of its Libyan affiliate, according to the U.S. government official, who says Libyan fighters frequently go back and forth between Libya and Syria and Iraq. The increasing globalization of ISIS raises some interesting questions for the Obama administration and for Congress. Last month Obama put forward a proposal for a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force specifically targeting ISIS. Obama's AUMF proposal mentions combating ISIS in its heartland of Syria and Iraq, but it doesn't mention the dozen other countries where ISIS now has a presence or foothold. Interventionist Republicans will likely want to see an AUMF that specifically targets other groups allied to ISIS that are outside of Syria and Iraq. Many Democrats will be uncomfortable about such an expansion. The ball is now in Congress' court to decide how geographically wide the scope of the fight against ISIS should be. It will be an interesting debate: on one side, those who want to prolong indefinitely what is already America's longest war, against jihadist terrorist groups like ISIS that have affiliates from Algeria to Afghanistan; and, on the other, those who want to circumscribe that war both in time and in space. Given the fact that a broadly written AUMF that was passed in the days after 9/11 has allowed the United States to conduct military operations in half a dozen Muslim countries over the course of the past 14 years, a new authorization that specifies both a sunset provision and also a specific geographic scope would be a useful check on executive power. And such an authorization could be amended if a substantial new threat from an ISIS affiliate emerges.", "raw_output": "Bergen: Boko Haram is the latest of terrorist groups in 12 countries to pledge allegiance to ISIS .\nHe says the spread of ISIS poses questions for Obama, Congress in deciding future of fight against terrorism .", "trunc_input": "(CNN)In the past eight months, ISIS has seeded itself in some dozen countries around the globe.

{"raw_input": "The soaring value of the pound has provided a major boost for British holidaymakers. Breaks in Europe have become more affordable as sterling has risen strongly against the euro and other currencies. It means trippers get nearly 15 per cent more for their money than a year ago, according to the Post Office Travel Money City Costs Barometer. Last month the pound hit a seven-year high against the euro at 1.35 euros, knocking about £70 off the cost of a £500 trip compared with 2014. Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, offers bargain hunters the best value as a city break destination, says a study . Budapest, Hungary, also offers British travellers a great deal, with a weekend getaway tallying £119.77 . However, a trip to the US has become significantly more expensive, with £500 buying only $722.45, down from $797 a year ago. City breaks have overtaken beach holidays as the most popular getaway choice for British tourists, according to a new study. With the pound strengthening against the euro and other currencies, prices have dropped by as much as 22 per cent over last year in three quarters of the cities included in Post Office Travel Money's annual report on city costs. Eastern European cities offer bargain hunters the best value with Vilnius, Lithuania, topping the list. The newest eurozone member has seen a fall of over 15 per cent year-on-year with a three-course evening meal for two including drinks and two nights' accommodation coming in at just £100.04. The cost of a weekend break in Vilnius is half of what visitors would pay in perennial favourites Paris, Rome and Amsterdam. Budapest is another great money-saving destination, where a two night getaway comes in at just £119.77. And in Riga, travellers will not only benefit from cheap transport options, but also the cheapest rate (£36) for a two-night stay in a three-star city centre hotel during the month of April. In Riga, Estonia, not only is transport extremely affordable, but three-star city centre hotels are cheapest . And when it comes to Western Europe, Post Office Travel Money recommends heading to Athens for a deal . 1. Vilnius, Lithuania - £100.04 . 2. Budapest, Hungary - £119.77 . 3. Riga, Latvia - £120.39 . 4. Tallinn, Estonia - £131.28 . 5. Athens, Greece - £131.35 . 6. Dubrovnik, Croatia - £139.83 . 7. Prague, Czech Republic - £141.24 . 8. Lisbon, Portugal - £141.37 . 9. Krakow, Poland - £144.96 . 10. Strasbourg, France - £169.60 . *Cost of two nights' accommodation and a three-course meal for two with drinks . But it's not only Eastern Europe that offers UK tourists some serious value. Athens, which is a new entry in the report, comes in fifth with a weekend city break coming in at just £131.35, which puts it as the cheapest in Western Europe. Last year's cheapest Western break, Lisbon, dropped to eighth place this year. The Czech city of Prague also offers great bang for a British traveller's buck, boasting cheap meals and drinks. Dining out costs as little as £23.94 for two people, while a bottle of beer is just £1.13. Krakow, Poland, and Strasbourg, France, are two additional new entries to the list this year. Proving that not all French cities must be needlessly expensive, Strasbourg is noteworthy for being 35 per cent cheaper than Paris. For the third consecutive year, Stockholm is Europe's most expensive city with holidaymakers spending an average of £311.01 for a two-night getaway. London is the seventh most expensive city break, with costs averaging £266.65, according to the study. While perennial favourite, Paris, is a very expensive French destination, Strasbourg offers good value . If money is not a concern, Stockholm has been named Europe's most expensive city for the third year in a row . Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: 'It's a win/win situation for UK holidaymakers this year in European cities because prices are down in the majority of cities we surveyed, thanks to the soaring value of sterling.' However, he does recommend that travellers do their homework before setting out, as prices do vary significantly across cities. 'Remember that the cost of meals and drinks will need to be added into the spending budget, as city breaks are never all-inclusive holidays,' he explains. 'Over the course of a two- or three-night break, these can make a big difference to the cost of a city break and the low prices in Prague, Athens and Budapest will make these cities strong contenders for a bargain break rival to the Baltic states.'", "raw_output": "Weekend breaks have overtaken beach holidays as most popular getaway .\nPost Office Travel Money have compiled best value European cities .\nFor a break on a budget, head to Eastern Europe, Athens or Strasbourg .", "trunc_input": "The soaring value of the pound has provided a major boost for British holidaymakers.

Two years ago Wales became the first team to win the championship after losing their first game and history could repeat itself should Warren Gatland's side overcome Grand Slam-chasing Ireland at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. Wales lost their first game of the 2015 championship to England in Cardiff but back-to-back wins in Scotland and France have put them back into title contention. Taulupe Faletau takes on the French defence during his side's victory in Paris in round three . '2013 was great and the win against England at the end was probably the most satisfying I've had,' said British and Irish Lions number eight Faletau. 'To lose the first game in 2013 [to Ireland] and to have people on your backs and knocking you down... then to come back from that as a team was great. 'When the final whistle went against England it was amazing, but if we could replicate that it would probably be even better. 'Just doing it again I think would make it better.' Wales' title hopes seemed a distant dream when England recovered from a first-half deficit in the tournament opener to run out 21-16 winners. But successive wins on the road in Edinburgh and Paris have lifted Welsh spirits before confronting impressive Irish opponents who have already recorded victories over Italy, France and England. Faletau brings down France prop Uini Atonio as Warren Gatland's side triumphed at the Stade de France . 'The boys put a good shift in and we got the result we wanted in Paris,' Faletau said of last weekend's Stade de France success. 'It was a good day at the office for the pack and the platform we had at the scrum, especially for me, was noticeable. 'It's what we want going forward and the longer we spend together the more we seem to get better. 'Hopefully we can build on last weekend and keep our tournament alive.' Faletau seems set to lock horns again with his old Lions team-mate Jamie Heaslip as the Ireland number eight is on course to make a dramatic return from injury. Heaslip cracked three vertebrae when he was kneed in the back by France lock Pascal Pape in Dublin last month, but Faletau believes Ireland will do everything in their power to have the Leinster man available at the Millennium Stadium. Faletau seems set to lock horns again with his old Lions team-mate Jamie Heaslip in Cardiff on Saturday .

{"raw_input": "Mathematics is probably not a subject that many people find sexy, but it could hold the key to finding true love. Mathematicians have developed a series of theories that can help people find the perfect partner. These include tips such as not trying to hide the less attractive parts of your appearance in your online dating profile pictures and looking for people who had fewer colds as a child. Scroll down for video . Dr Hannah Fry's (pictured left) book (right) explains how maths underpins love. She said the Discreet Choice Theory dictates that if there are two women - A and B - who men rank as equally attractive, if a third woman comes along who looks like a less attractive version of woman A, then woman A becomes more popular . They have also proposed mathematical approaches to finding the perfect wife or husband - by not choosing to settle down until after the age of 22 years old. Dr Hannah Fry, a lecturer at University College London and author of a new book on The Mathematics of Love, outlined the theories at the Oxford Literary Festival. She said that choosing friends who are slightly less attractive than you when going out looking for love could also bring advantages. This is known as the Discreet Choice Theory, where the presence of an irrelevant alternative can change how you view your choices. In her book, Dr Hannah Fry suggest a number of techniques to help people find true love. Have friends who are less attractive than you: Known as Discreet Choice Theory, the idea is that if there are two women - A and B - who men rank as being equally attractive, if a third woman comes along who looks like a less attractive version of woman A, then woman A becomes more popular with the men. Highlight your flaws:  Analysis from dating websites has shown that often it is not those who are rated the 'most attractive' who get the most responses from other users. Instead it appears to be those that divide opinion - so those that have something that sets them apart from the rest of the crowds. Men with bald heads, for example, should not wear a hat to cover their pate as their lack of hair will be attractive to some. Those who are overweight should also not use clever photo cropping to hide what they perceive as flaws. This means people who find these traits attractive will face less competition than messaging those who have 'perfect' profile pictures. This formula produced by psychologist John Gottmann and mathematician James Murray predicts how positive or negative a wife and husband will be when they respond in the next turn of a conversation. The most successful couples are those that allow each other to complain and don't let trivial problems build up . Choose 'healthy' looking partners: Dr Fry also explained that looking for those who tend to be heathlier are also likely to be more attractive. Don't settle down until 37% of your 'dating period' has past: The Optimal Stopping Period theory dictates that people should only start looking for the partner they want to settle down with after 37 per cent of their 'dating period' has past. If, for example, they are looking to get married by the age of 35 years old, and start dating from the age of 15, they should discount all partners they have before the age of 22.4 years old. After this time has past, marry the first 'best' partner you get: After the 37 per cent period has past, Dr Fry said people should marry the first partner they find that is better than any that came before. While this might sound like a risky strategy - for example if all subsequent partners fail to live up to the dream match in their teenage years - it is actually used in nature by some species of fish when mating. And if married, follow the 'positive' formula: This formula, devised by psychologist John Gottmann and mathematician James Murray predicts how positive or negative a wife and husband will be when they respond in the next turn of a conversation. The most successful couples are those that allow each other to complain and don't let trivial problems build up. The idea is that if there are two women - A and B - who men rank as being equally attractive, if a third woman comes along who looks like a less attractive version of woman A, then woman A becomes more popular with the men. Dr Fry said: 'If you are trying to choose a wingman or wingwoman, choose someone as similar to you as possible, just slightly less attractive.' Other mathematicians have dedicated a fair amount of time to the subject of finding and keeping love. One mathematician - Peter Backus who was a pHD student at Warwick University at the time - wrote a paper called 'Why I don't have a girlfriend' after a three-year love drought. He calculated - using an mathematical formula known as the Drake equation - that of all the available women in the UK, there were just 26 who were appropriate for him. He also predicted that he had just a one in 285,000 chance of meeting one of them on a night out. Video courtesy of TED - watch the full video here . Being unconventionally attractive may also be an advantage, according to the mathematician's research. This is because it reduces competition for people who find those flaws appealing. Sarah Jessica Parker (shown) divides opinion with many people thinking she's beautiful and others disagreeing . Fortunately for him, it seems he did meet one of them - a girl called Rose from London who he met at a dinner with friends while he was working at Warwick University - and has now married her. According to Dr Fry, however, there are ways of increasing your chances of meeting the one. In her book she provides a series of mathematically supported tips for those looking to find love and keep it. It is the perfect invention for an angst-ridden teenager or a suspicious spouse - scientists have paved the way for a test that can tell if someone is truly in love. Neurologists claim to have discovered the secrets of how different emotions affect the brain. By poring over scans of people in different stages of romance, they think they have the first clues as to what true love looks like. Initial results show a dozen different areas of the brain is affected in different ways by the emotions of love. A cocktail of chemicals carry messages from one region to another, which may allow scientists in the future to use MRI scans to tell what someone truly feels. Early results published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience reveal that the team are already confident they have discovered the part of the brain - the caudate nucleus - which is most active at the end of a love affair.‘ . If the other parts of the puzzle can be pieced together, they may one day be able to tell exactly how someone feels with a brief scan. Analysis from dating websites has shown that often it is not those who are rated the 'most attractive' who get the most responses from other users. Instead it appears to be those that divide opinion - so those that have something that sets them apart from the rest of the crowds. Men with bald heads, for example, should not wear a hat to cover their pate as their lack of hair will be attractive to some. Those who are overweight should also not use clever photo cropping to hide what they perceive as flaws. She explained that this is because often people who find these traits attractive will also be more likely to message as they know it is not attractive to everyone. This means they will face less competition than messaging those who have 'perfect' profile pictures. Dr Fry said: 'People who are unbelievably good looking will always do well, but the rest of us would be better to divide opinion.' She also outlined a maths based strategy for finding a wife or husband known as the Optimal Stopping Period. This states that people should only start looking for the partner you want to settle down with after 37 per cent of their 'dating period' has passed. If, for example, a oerson is looking to get married by the age of 35 years old, and starts dating from the age of 15, they should discount all partners they have before the age of 22.4 years old. Meanwhile, the Optimal Stopping Period theory says people should only start looking for the partner they want to settle down with after 37% of their 'dating period' has past. If, for example, they want to get married by the age of 35, and start dating at 15, they should discount all partners before the age of 22.4 years old . Neurologists recently claimed to have discovered the secrets of how different emotions affect the brain. By poring over scans of people in different stages of romance, they claim to have the first clues as to what true love looks like. The areas affected by the feeling of love are highlight .

Dr Fry also explained that looking for those who tend to be heathlier are also likely to be more attractive. According to The Times, she said: 'As a child, every time you get a cough or a cold your face tends to grow in a slightly asymmetrical way. 'So in thinking symmetrical faces are more attractive, you are validating an underlying bill of health.' However, recent research has suggested that facial symmetry has little to do with health during childhood but more perhaps a signal of genetic 'fitness'. And for those who are already married, maths can also be used to help predict whether their relationship will last by looking for patterns. Psychologist John Gottmann and mathematician James Murray produced a formula that looks at the mood of each partner when alone, together and how they influence each other. This found that some couples often got into spirals of negativity that would ultimately lead to divorce. The most successful couples are those that allow each other room to complain and do not store up trivial things to become a bit deal. The same formula has also been used to help predict the outcomes of an arms race between countries.

{"raw_input": "Any TV fan worth their salt will be familiar with EastEnders' character Zoe Slater's dramatic wail: 'You ain't my mother!' And now the iconic 2001 scene where feisty character Kat Slater revealed that she was, in fact, Zoe's mother, has been named the greatest soap storyline of all time. In a poll of 2,000 soap fans, the scene - in which Kat's confession that Zoe was conceived after Kat was abused by her uncle Harry - topped the list of favourite tears, tantrums and cliffhangers. Scroll down for video . The Eastenders' storyline revealing Kat Slater to be the mother of her 'younger sister' Zoe has been named the greatest British soap narrative of all time . The iconic scene sees Zoe shout: 'You ain't my mother!' in the street before Kat screeches back: 'Yes I am!' The famous street row between the pair, where Zoe yells 'You ain't my mother' at Kat before finding out the truth even featured in Australian soap Neighbours' recent tribute video to celebrate EastEnders' 30th anniversary. Richard Hillman driving the Platt family into the canal in Coronation Street came second in the poll, followed by Hayley Cropper's courageous cancer battle and subsequent death in 2014. EastEnders bad guy Dirty Den getting shot in 1989 and the Coronation Street tram crash completed the top five. The episode was given the top spot in a poll of 2,000 soap fans on their favourite storylines . As well as old favourites, the recent Eastenders cliffhanger of 'who killed Lucy Beale' also made it in to the top ten, taking the number seven slot. A spokesman for survey site OnePoll.com, which commissioned the research, said that the winning storyline thoroughly deserved its title. 'The Kat and Zoe storyline is something most people are familiar with, even if they aren't an avid EastEnders fan. The tear-jerking episode of Coronation Street where Hayley Cropper died earned third place on the list . The recent EastEnders storyline 'Who Killed Lucy Beale' earned seventh place on the list after attracting millions of viewers in a week of live episodes to celebrate the soap's 30th anniversary . 'It had everything a great soap storyline needs - a blazing row, some tears and a huge shock just as the episode comes to a close.' He added that the reason that some of the older story lines had found their way into the top 50 was because they had a large impact on our lives. 'There have been many brilliant and gripping storylines over the years - whether they are tearjerkers like the moment Hayley died in Coronation Street or high drama like the live tram crash. 'Soaps are a huge part of our culture and these results show the storylines are remembered years after they are first screened.' In second place was Richard Hillman driving The Platts into a canal in a 2003 episode of Coronation Street . Sixth place in the poll went to the famous moment Dirty Den handed wife Angie divorce papers in the EastEnders' 1986 Christmas Day episode, followed by the London-based soap's huge 'Who Killed Lucy' story. After almost a year's worth of teases, the killer was finally revealed to be her half-brother Bobby during a week of live episodes during the EastEnders 30th anniversary celebration. Little Mo's domestic abuse storyline in EastEnders came eighth followed by Scott and Charlene's wedding in Neighbours and Deirdre Barlow being jailed for fraud in Coronation Street. Little Mo's domestic abuse story also stuck in viewers heads as the 2001 drama came eighth in the poll . Other storylines to feature in the top 20 include the whodunnit storyline 'Who Shot Phil' in EastEnders, after the hard-man was shot on his doorstep, Corrie's Tyrone suffering domestic abuse at the hands of partner Kirsty and Mike Baldwin dying in rival Ken Barlow's arms on the cobbles. The Emmerdale plane crash in 1993, the body under the patio in Brookside, Max and Stacey's affair in EastEnders and the famous love triangle between brothers Phil and Grant Mitchell and Grant's wife Sharon are also high on the list. More than half of the storylines featured in the poll were ones from EastEnders, including the long-running storyline of 'Who Shot Phil Mitchell' that was on our screens over 2000-2001 coming 11th in the poll . EastEnders features heavily in the top 50 with more than half the list made up of storylines from the soap. Old favourites such as Michelle Fowler falling pregnant with Dirty Den's baby as a teenager and Nick Cotton trying to kill mum Dot all feature alongside more recent storylines such as Dean Watt's attack on Linda. Brookside, which was last on our screens in 2003, also features several times with Nat and Georgia's incest and Beth and Margaret's lesbian kiss, which was seen as a ground-breaking storyline at the time it was aired. 1.

{"raw_input": "A 'nearly pristine' 600 million-year-old sponge has been uncovered in southern China. Scientists believe the sponge – which represents the most primitive animal on Earth - is the oldest ever found. Its discovery pushes back the start of the evolution of multicellular animals to before the Cambrian explosion 541 million years ago. A 'nearly pristine' 600 million-year-old sponge has been uncovered in southern China.Scientists believe the sponge – which represents the most primitive creature on Earth - is the oldest ever found . The Cambrian Explosion, around 541 million years ago, was a wide variety of animals burst onto the evolutionary scene. Before about 580 million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells occasionally organised into colonies. Over the following 70 or 80 million years, the rate of evolution accelerated  and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today. It ended with the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction event, approximately 488 million years ago. The latest discovery pushes back the date of multicellular animal evolution to 60 million years before the Cambrian explosion started. Sponges, also known as Porifera, are multicellular organisms that have bodies covered with pores and channels that allow water to circulate through them. Scientists have still to confirm when they first appeared on Earth. Estimates range from 700 million years ago to a time known as the Cambrian period, which took place 541 million to 485 million years ago. The latest finding would place the sponge around 60 million years before the Cambrian started. Researchers want to pin down the date because they believe it is key to understanding early animal evolution. The split between sponges and most other animals was a major event in the early history of life on our planet. The sponge, found in the Doushantuo Formation, is just over one millimetre in height and width, according to researchers from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology. To get a good look, scientists used scanning electron microscopy and X-ray technology. The team has named it Eocyathispongia qiania and say that it is made up of hundreds of thousands of cells. Its structure is formed in three tube-like chambers that are fixed to a common base, with cell structures that resemble those in modern sponges. Scientists also found surface cells that indicate pores, like modern sponges, which control water flowing into the organism. The sponge, found in the Doushantuo Formation in southern China (left), suggests the date of multicellular animal evolution was 60 million years before the Cambrian explosion started. Scientists found surface cells that indicate pores, like modern sponges (right), which control water flowing into the organism . There was an area inside one of the tubes with pits surrounded by raised collars - a possible precursor to choanocyte cells which modern sponges use to move water through their bodies. As well as being one of the oldest of the really old sponge fossils found, the find also represents one of the most pristine. The researchers say they have more material from the site where the sponge was found, and will be sifting through it looking for more tiny sponges and perhaps other organisms. Lead author Maoyan Zhu told IBTimes UK that the find suggests that animals on Earth began diversifying 600 million years ago. 'Discovery of additional specimens would confirm that the fossil represents a Precambrian sponge,' he said. 'But features of the fossil are consistent with sponge anatomy… fossils of similarly advanced eumetazoans [all major animal groups except sponges] may yet lie in the fossil record.'

'Either from a libertarian perspective, the way we treat non-violent drug crimes is problematic, and from a fiscal perspective, it's breaking the bank, that you end up spending so much more on prison than you would with these kids being in school or even going to college, that it's counterproductive'. He spoke of people being turned into 'hardened criminals' while in prison, which created a cycle of them returning to jail.

The Wire chronicled the effects of the drug war as it was waged in Maryland's largest city in the early 2000s, showing how both drug use and the heavy-handed response of the law enforcement devastated communities. Mr Simon, an outspoken critic of the federal government's drug policies, did not hold back as he spoke with the President. 'What the drugs don't destroy, the war against them tears apart,' he said.

{"raw_input": "A female British adventurer is preparing for the final leg of her gruelling challenge to circumnavigate the world using just human power - four years after she set off. Sarah Outen MBE, 29, has already travelled a staggering 20,500 miles since she left Tower Bridge in London in a kayak on April 1, 2011. The Oxford graduate paddled from Britain to France and cycled 11,000 miles across Europe before jumping back in her kayak to travel from Russia to Japan. Scroll down for video . Sarah Outen, pictured after arriving in New York by bike from Alaska, is preparing for the final leg of her gruelling challenge to circumnavigate the world using just human power - four years after she set off . Sarah  has already travelled a staggering 20,500 miles since she left Tower Bridge in London in a kayak on April 1, 2011 . She then set off to row across the Pacific Ocean to Alaska but had to be rescued after her boat was battered by 80mph winds in a three-day tropical storm. She said she strapped herself to the bunk of her rowing boat while she waited for help. She said: 'That was really scary, it was a really intense few days being in those conditions and being alone. 'The water was coming in and there was nothing I could do but wait so I lay on my bunk strapped in and floated for three days. The Oxford graduate paddled from Britain to France and cycled 11,000 miles across Europe before jumping back in her kayak to travel from Russia to Japan . Love boat: Miss Outen proposed to her girlfriend Lucy from the middle of the sea using a satellite phone . The adventurer has 3,000 miles left to go before she completes her trip . A moment of respite: Sarah setting up camp at Shalti lake, in China, in June 2011 . Sarah in a sunbaked Gobi desert during her 11,000-mile ride to the edge of Russia . The route Sarah has taken since leaving London in 2011, with the final leg a row across the Atlantic . April 2011 - Sets off from Tower Bridge in London. Kayaks from London to France, then cycles 11,000 miles across Europe and Asia before kayaking from Russia to Japan. May 2012 - Rows across the Pacific Ocean to Alaska but is rescued by Japanese coastguards a month into the five month journey. She goes home to recover for nine months where she meets her fiancee Lucy. April 2013 - Returns to Japan and rows across the Pacific Ocean to Alaska, arriving in September 2013. Proposes to Lucy via satellite phone from middle of Pacific Ocean. Returns home because of Alaskan winter. May 2014 - Returns to Alaska and kayaks 1,500 miles along the Aleutian Islands. Has just a two week break before cycling 4,500 miles through Alaska, Canada and the United States in one of the harshest winters the country has seen. March 2015 - Arrives in New York. Plans to stay for two weeks before cycling 400 miles to Cape Cod and then rowing solo for 3,000 miles across the Atlantic Ocean back to the UK. She will then cycle, kayak and row back to Tower Bridge aiming to arrive in September . 'I zoned out as much as I could and there was just one occasion when I lost it and started crying. 'The Japanese coastguard plane was flying overhead and I had to go out to let off a flare so they could find my position. 'I wasn't strapped in and a wave hit and I got thrown around the cabin and I was exhausted and scared so just burst into tears. 'But I told myself to pull it together and luckily got rescued.' The physically demanding journey has also been an emotional one for Sarah who proposed to partner Lucy Allen, 28, whilst she was in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. She said: 'I met Lucy during the time at home so in a way I was lucky that I capsized and was forced to abandon that row to Alaska the first time. 'We had talked about getting married and said we would propose to each other when I reached Alaska. 'But I was alone in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and I thought why wait so I picked up the satellite phone and just went for it. 'I had to ask her twice because she couldn't hear me properly but she said yes.' She returned to Japan in April 2013 and completed the five-month journey which made her the first and youngest person to row solo from Japan to the Aleutian Islands. Incredibly, she then kayaked 1,500 miles along the Aleutian Islands with pal Justine Curgenven before cycling 4,500 miles through Alaska, Canada and the United States. Since then she has battled plunging -40C temperatures and narrowly avoided being attacked by grizzly bears. Sarah, from Oakham, Rutland, eventually arrived in New York last Thursday and is having a two-week break until she cycles another 400 miles to Cape Cod. She will then prepare to row Happy Socks for the final leg of her journey, a solo trip across 3,000 miles of the Atlantic Ocean back to the UK. She said the most testing part of her incredible trip has been camping in plunging temperatures and tackling wild bears along her route. She said: 'It was difficult because overnight the temperature dropped below -40C several times which made breathing in the tent very difficult. 'There were ice particles in the air when I was up in Alaska and northern Canada between August and October. 'Some kind people invited me in to their homes but I mostly camped and I knew bears were around so at night my mind would play tricks on me. 'There was no-one around and the sound of bears in the forest would keep me awake at night. 'I only saw one bear on the bike when a brown grizzly ran across the path I was cycling on and disappeared. 'But during the kayaking along the Aleutian Islands we saw lots of grizzly bears on the banks of the shore. 'One evening I was in a stream having a wash and I suddenly saw this big grizzly bear walking towards me downstream. 'All I could do was get out as quick as I could and luckily my clothes were on the shore so he had a good sniff of them and that slowed him down. 'We were able to make a fuss and throw some stones in the water and luckily that scared him off but he was only a few feet away from us.'

The man, later identified as Jamison Childress, 20, was approached by two border agents after setting off ground sensors when crossing the border on Thursday afternoon, according to US Customs and Border Protection. He displayed 'erratic and threatening' behavior toward the agents and sprayed one of them with an incapacitating spray, the agency said. One of the agents then shot the man in the head and killed him about 300 yards from the border near Sumas, Washington. Scroll down for video . A man, later identified as Jamison Childress, 20, was shot near the US-Canada border (pictured) after 'erratic and threatening' behavior . Border authorities did not release the man's identity, which was later confirmed by a local medical examiner. He is thought to be from British Columbia. Whatcom County Sheriff Bill Elfo said that he was wanted in connection to a murder. Childress was set to stand trial for 2013 assault and mischief charges on Tuesday in Prince George, British Columbia, according to the Abbotsford BC News. He was also set to face charges for theft later this year. It was not clear where the murder he is connected to took place. Lawyer Michael Reed represented Childress previously and said that he was surprised by news of a murder charge, The Canadian Press reported. Reed expressed 'disbelief' about the incident. 'People cross the international border to bring crime and violence to our communities,' said at a news conference. The agent who was sprayed with the chemical required medical attention but was not seriously hurt, the agency said. The incident occurred at the small border crossing of Sumas, about 100 miles north of Seattle, Washington . Both agents involved in the incident, who have served 10 and 19 years, were placed on administrative leave. They were not identified Friday. A multiagency task force, including the sheriff's office, will investigate the shooting, which occurred shortly after 2.30 p.m. on Thursday. Sumas is about 100 miles north of Seattle. Officials released few details at the news conference, saying the investigation was in the early stages. They declined to release other details about the dead man. 'We have not confirmed his citizenship,' Elfo said, though the man was confirmed to have entered the US from Canada. 'It was apparent he was erratic and aggressively approached the agents,' he said. A hatchet was found in the man's backpack, but it was not displayed at the agents. One agent's face was burned by the spray, which Elfo did not identify.

{"raw_input": "(CNN)The debate over health care reform once again blooms in D.C., but this time Democrats and the President whose legacy rests on the Affordable Care Act are tending a garden challenged by some rather invasive species. The GOP has kicked off its season by pulling Obamacare up by the roots in its proposed 2016 House budget. But this budget will not become law. And so Republicans are also preparing strategic plays if the Supreme Court rules in their favor this summer, or if a Republican wins the White House next year backed by complementary majorities in the House and Senate. Either scenario would mortally wound Obamacare. But this isn't a zero sum game. Smart Republicans already know they don't win just because the other side loses.  Upending Obamacare may poison the GOP's standing with 16.4 million Americans who will face adverse, even dire consequences without legislative patches to the law, or a swift switch to a solid alternative health care policy. This week, the conservative weekly The Washington Examiner aimed to mark Obamacare's fifth anniversary by asking a panel whether to \"reform, replace or restart\" the law. A gas leak scuttled the event. Once they've regrouped for their next panel, Republicans should instead entertain a different R: Revise. So far every plan Republicans are offering strikes out any mandate to purchase insurance, which, oddly for a party celebrating self-reliance, encourages some people to continue shifting their adult responsibilities onto others. Many of the GOP plans replace the subsidies that make exchange plans affordable for low-income Americans with tax credits. Tax credits don't make much sense when you don't have a lot of taxes to pay in the first place. These alternatives appear to be thinly veiled transitions away from the key Obamacare principle of providing guaranteed access. To date the law has reduced the rates of uninsured Americans by a whopping 35%.  Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, lifted his veil even during his own plan's debut by insisting \"every last word of Obamacare must be repealed\" while promoting his own Health Care Choices Act that ditches subsidies and the mandate. Republican presidential front-runner Jeb Bush shares Cruz's preference to dismantle the \"monstrosity\" altogether, describing his preference for cheaper catastrophic insurance that helps people with massive bills but leaves poor Americans to fend for themselves when it comes to needless perks -- like insulin and blood pressure pills. And besides repealing the ACA, House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, R-Georgia, wants to tear into President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society achievements as well.  His budget proposal dismantles the federal Medicaid program by slashing its funding and devolving it to the states, while asking seniors on Medicare to try their luck with a voucher-discounted private insurance. What these approaches don't get is that we live in a country entirely populated by citizens who want and expect to receive medical care when they need it, yet not all of these citizens want to pay anything for the privilege. The beating heart of Obamacare is its mandate to purchase health insurance, which keeps costs down for everyone, makes it fiscally feasible to cover patients with pre-existing conditions, and makes government subsidies possible for those who can't afford any insurance without them. If Republicans shift their focus to revising Obamacare, there are an array of spots to trim and weeds to pull, and they can expect many Democrats to join in the work. But after dealing with a withering onslaught of over 60 Republican attempts to kill the bill, Democrats can't make even the most basic fixes for fear of losing everything. But there are some places to look. Even ACA supporters can acknowledge some specific anti-competitive features in the law.  This should interest Republicans. The ACA's push toward offloading risk onto hospitals rather than insurers is encouraging hospital consolidation, with large hospital corporations seeking to build economies of scale to offset future risk  This trend may drive up costs as hospitals face less competition. Meanwhile consumers shopping the exchange plans can select from few in-network hospitals and physicians, again making the health care marketplace less competitive. The United States may be graced with institutions offering stellar care in complex conditions that attract patients across state lines as well as across the world, centers that contribute to medicine generally through their research and training. But going out of state to seek such care isn't an option for many patients on exchange plans.  Cruz proposes opening up health insurance markets nationally, an idea that we should build on. Years of a rough economy have left many consumers without the income or savings to pay the high copays, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums that Obamacare uses as a cost-control measure. Among families making 250% to 400% over the federal poverty line, 55% to 68% can't make their deductible, depending on their plan. The numbers are considerably worse for families under that threshold, and even for families making over 400% of the poverty line, 25% to 38% can't pay the out of pocket maximum if they become seriously ill. Despite these costs, the ACA penalizes responsible consumers further by capping flexible spending accounts. Furthermore, Obamacare is in part more expensive than it might be because it takes a gamble covering preventive testing for people with no sign of disease for \"free,\" yet makes patients with chronic conditions pay deductibles even when we know their care will save money in the long run. That's not the most rational distribution of funds if we're trying to do the greatest good for the greatest number at the lowest cost. Since Jeb Bush is interested in focusing on the big-ticket items and not sweating the small stuff, perhaps this is an area where he can throw his support. Obamacare isn't a work of art by any means. It's a messy, pragmatic attempt to reach a goal the majority of Americans want: access to affordable health care when it's needed. Some rather fundamental revisions lie ahead, like a forthcoming administrative decision on whether to continue allowing state variability among the prescribed Essential Health Benefits it covers. So, my advice to Republicans is that they pick one or two specific aspects of Obamacare they'd like to improve, let's have the policy debate, then introduce your legislative fix to the existing law, leaving its beating heart intact. Show you're open to constructively improving the ACA and I'm sure we'll see Democrats start coming to the table with their own pet peeves about the law. 2016 doesn't have to be a hyperbolic, hyperventilating contest for the fate of 16.4 million Americans.", "raw_output": "Ford Vox: With its budget proposal to kill Obamacare, or hopes the Supreme Court will do the same, the GOP makes a mistake .\nHe says 16.4 million Americans benefiting.

{"raw_input": "He has been embroiled in a well-documented feud with Italian designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana after the former called babies born through in-vitro fertilization (IVF)  'synthetic'. But Sir Elton John - whose two sons Zachary, four, and Elijah, two, were conceived with the help of a surrogate and artificial insemination - appeared to offer an olive branch when he declared his love for the fashion duo in Las Vegas on Wednesday night. Speaking on stage at his concert at the Colosseum, Elton included the pair in a list of inspirational people who have changed the world, such as Nelson Mandela and Lady Diana, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . 'I love Dolce & Gabbana!' Elton John (pictured on March 11) spoke from the stage on Wednesday night where he declared his love for D&G despite a recent feud . Famous fans! Elton's show was watched by newly single Bradley Cooper, Miles Tellar, Jonah Hill and British comedian Jimmy Carr on Wednesday . While his praise for the designers was greeted with laughter by the audience, Elton went on to add: 'Listen, the band have been wearing Dolce & Gabbana, I love Dolce & Gabbana clothes.' Sir Elton announced last week that he would boycott the brand after designer Domenico Dolce criticised IVF, saying: 'You are born and you have a father and mother. At least it should be like that. That's why I'm not convinced by what I call chemical children, synthetic babies.' Elton, who is married to David Furnish, responded furiously, writing on Sunday: 'How dare you refer to my beautiful children as \"synthetic\". Controversy: Designer Domenico Dolce (right) has defended his controversial remarks and said he 'respects all the world'. He is pictured with business partner Stefano Gabbana (left) 'And shame on you for wagging your judgmental little fingers at IVF – a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfil their dream of having children. 'Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again. #BoycottDolceGabbana.' His outburst prompted a mass social media campaign, as 66,000 people joined his call to stop buying clothes from the luxury brand. Boycott: Sir Elton John (pictured with his husband David Furnish and their children), spoke out against Dolce and Gabbana and claimed that he will never wear any of their clothes ever again after their comments . Equality campaigners and celebrities also weighed in on the dispute - gay rights activist Peter Tatchell has organised a protest outside D&G's London store on Thurday to show the public's opposition to the inflammatory comments. Victoria Beckham, a former Dolce and Gabbana ambassador who is close friends with Sir Elton, offered her support with the message: 'Sending love to Elton David Zachary Elijah & all the beautiful IVF babies x vb.' OMD&G! Elton was seen carrying a Dolce & Gabbana bag only days after launching a feud against the brand . But the designers hit back - Stefano Gabbana told an Italian newspaper: 'It's useless, this is just an authoritarian way of seeing things: if you agree with me, good, otherwise I'll attack. And I wrote to him, in the comments on Instagram: fascist.' Things took a twist when Elton was seen carrying a D&G-branded bag only 24 hours after he entered into a high-profile row with the designers over their criticism of fertility treatments. Caught red handed: The star clearly didn't seem too oposed to the fashion house even though he encouraged others to boycott . Photographers said Sir Elton was seen carrying the Dolce & Gabbana bag on March 16, after being dropped off in his chauffeur-driven SUV. A spokesman for the singer confirmed: ‘Yes he was carrying the bag but he hadn’t been shopping. And it should not detract from their original message or the boycott.’ Elton's comments on-stage in Las Vegas came after Dolce insisted his views were private, personal beliefs that were based on his sense of a traditional Sicilian family. In an interview with CNN, Dolce insisted he did not judge people who chose the procedure, and said: 'I believe in the traditional family. 'It is impossible to change my culture for something different. It's me...I respect all the world, all the culture.' Dolce said he would not be not boycotting the artist and added: 'I love the music of Elton John.' He said he believed they could end the dispute and added: 'Every people resolve everything by talk...we start to talk, the problem is resolved. 'Every people [has] freedom for choosing what they want. This for me is democracy. I respect you because you choose what you want. 'I respect me because I choose what I want.

{"raw_input": "The complexity of the human brain - with its 86 billion neurons - has puzzled scientists ever since the Greek philosopher Plato attempted to understand how it worked. Now researchers are claiming that our brains may in fact be far simpler than had previously been believed - and it took research on sea slugs to reveal it. Neuroscientists based at Manchester University and the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in Chicago, have studied the brains of sea slugs as they move. Researchers studied the brains of the sea slug Aplysia (pictured above), which have around 18,000 neurons . Their brains, while far smaller than our own, share some of the complex structures of higher organisms while their neurons are large and easy to observe. The researchers found that rather than creating a mass of confusing signals that appear in scans of the human brain, they were able to see neurons acting as groups. The act of remembering may be one of the major reasons why we forget, researchers have said. The groundbreaking research was able to identify identify neural fingerprints of specific memories, distinguishing brain activity patterns produced when viewing a picture of a necklace, say, from a picture of Marilyn Monroe. The study proved that intentional recall is beyond a simple reawakening of a memory; and actually leads us to forget other competing experiences that interfere with retrieval. The study from the University of Birmingham and the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge is the first to isolate the 'adaptive forgetting' mechanism in the human brain. The brain imaging study found that remembering dynamically alters which aspects of our past remain accessible. They found that these groups were actually laid out like tiles to form a circuit. The scientists say that similar patterns exist in the brains of other organisms, including humans, but are scaled up by millions of times. Dr Mark Humphries, a Medical Research Council fellow at Manchester University who was involved in the research, said: 'What happens in the brain during movement is currently only well understood for small, dedicated neural circuits. 'This research introduces new methods for pulling apart neural circuits to expose their inner building blocks. 'Our methods could be used to help understand how brain networks change in disease states and how drugs act to restore normal brain function.' Sea slugs have just 18,000 neurons in their entire nervous systems yet have been found to be remarkably similar to other organisms. Previous research has shown that they can form memories and signal muscle movements in the same way as higher organisms. Until recently scientists have had to study brain activity by looking at the action of individual neurons using electrodes. Even sophisticated brain scanning technology like functional magnetic resonance fails to provide a clear picture of how the brain is organised beyond its physical structures. The scientists studied neurons in the ganglion area of the brains of sea slugs, shown in the image above . The human brain (shown in the model above) is known to have specific structures that perform different roles but how neurons are organised within those has remained a mystery as studying them as they work is difficult . In the new research, which is published in the journal Neuron, the team of scientists were able to map how the large neurons in the brains of the sea slug Aplysia as they moved. Led by Angela Burno from the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, the researchers were able to do this by using a voltage sensitive dye and detecting the tiny spikes in current that occurred in the slugs' brains as the nerves that drive their muscles fired. They found there were four classes of neural ensembles that behaved in different ways - oscillatory, bursters, pausers and those where there was no strong activity. Until now scientists have had to study electrical signals of individual neurons or the whole brain (like above) These tended to be organised into modules or tiles that had related activity and pass signals between them in a loop. The researchers say the sea slugs could provide a useful analogy for when studying human brains.

{"raw_input": "A former Special Forces soldier is rounding up supporters for a leadership bid against Ed Miliband if he does not win the General Election, The Mail on Sunday has learned. Dan Jarvis, who entered the Commons only four years ago, has told potential supporters he is prepared to run if Mr Miliband fails to dislodge David Cameron from No 10. One senior Labour MP, who met privately with Mr Jarvis in the Commons a month ago, said: ‘Dan wants to go for it if the result is disappointing.' Ex-Special Forces: Dan Jarvis has told potential supporters he is prepared to run if Mr Miliband fails to dislodge David Cameron from No 10 . He added: 'I thought about it for a couple of weeks, then rang him to say he could count on my backing.’ The news has emerged as the Labour leader faces the embarrassment of two senior party figures openly debating his failings during a broadcast interview this week. With polling day barely six weeks away, Rochdale Labour MP Simon Danczuk will discuss Mr Miliband’s lack of voter appeal with party peer Lord Glasman in an interview broadcast on LBC on Monday evening. During the debate, Mr Danczuk asks: ‘What has Nigel Farage got that Ed Miliband doesn’t?’ The peer – a former adviser to Mr Miliband – responds: ‘He has got the ability to sit in the pub and be at his complete ease, which is a very magical gift. Ed is… from the seminar room.’ Mr Jarvis, the Shadow Justice Minister, is rapidly gaining support on the party back benches as a ‘clean skin’ candidate who, unlike many rivals, was not an adviser or Minister during the Blair or Brown governments and is ‘untainted’ by association with Mr Miliband’s inner circle. Some MPs also argue that the 42-year-old ex-Para’s military career – a rarity in Labour ranks – would be more appealing to voters than Mr Miliband’s background as a policy adviser. In any leadership contest, Mr Jarvis is likely to face the more experienced figures of health spokesman Andy Burnham, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna, education spokesman Tristram Hunt and ambitious frontbencher Liz Kendall. Ed Miliband faces the embarrassment of two senior party figures openly debating his failings during a broadcast interview this week . The backer added: ‘Dan has a clear view of his own strengths, and an even clearer view of his rivals’ weaknesses.’ Mr Jarvis became the first person since the Second World War to resign a military commission to contest a by-election. He successfully stood in Barnsley Central in 2011, shortly after his wife Caroline died of cancer, aged 43, leaving him to care for their two children. Mr Jarvis has since remarried and now has a third child. The former major spent 15 years in the Paras, and was awarded an MBE after serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo and Sierra Leone. In keeping with his action-man image, it was reported last week he had pacified a drunken thug wielding a bottle who demanded his wallet. Under party rules, if Mr Miliband fails to win power in May but doesn’t resign, a leadership election can be triggered only if 20 per cent of the party’s MPs nominate a specific challenger. The winner, elected by MPs, MEPs, party members and unions, would be announced at the party’s next annual conference.", "raw_output": "Dan Jarvis is gathering supporters for a leadership bid against Ed Miliband .\nHe is prepared to run if Mr Miliband fails to dislodge PM David Cameron .\nTwo senior party figures will debate the Labour leader's failings  this week .\nSome   argue that the ex-Para’s military career would be more appealing .", "trunc_input": "A former Special Forces soldier is rounding up supporters for a leadership bid against Ed Miliband if he does not win the General Election, The Mail on Sunday has learned.

In any leadership contest, Mr Jarvis is likely to face the more experienced figures of health spokesman Andy Burnham, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna, education spokesman Tristram Hunt and ambitious frontbencher Liz Kendall. Ed Miliband faces the embarrassment of two senior party figures openly debating his failings during a broadcast interview this week . The backer added: ‘Dan has a clear view of his own strengths, and an even clearer view of his rivals’ weaknesses.’ Mr Jarvis became the first person since the Second World War to resign a military commission to contest a by-election. He successfully stood in Barnsley Central in 2011, shortly after his wife Caroline died of cancer, aged 43, leaving him to care for their two children. Mr Jarvis has since remarried and now has a third child. The former major spent 15 years in the Paras, and was awarded an MBE after serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo and Sierra Leone. In keeping with his action-man image, it was reported last week he had pacified a drunken thug wielding a bottle who demanded his wallet. Under party rules, if Mr Miliband fails to win power in May but doesn’t resign, a leadership election can be triggered only if 20 per cent of the party’s MPs nominate a specific challenger. The winner, elected by MPs, MEPs, party members and unions, would be announced at the party’s next annual conference.", "trunc_output": "Dan Jarvis is gathering supporters for a leadership bid against

{"raw_input": "Friends of killer pilot Andreas Lubitz claim he is being framed for murder as part of an elaborate cover-up by his airline company to hide mechanical faults with the plane. They have set up a Facebook page titled 'Andreas Lubitz A320, we are against the hunt' where they have been sharing their theories about the cause of the Alps disaster. Some suggest the black box voice recorder had been tampered with by Germanwings parent company, Lufthansa, to make it appear as if Lubitz had deliberately crashed the plane. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Lubitz's home that he shared with his girlfriend in Dusseldorf has been blurred out on Google Maps in an apparent attempt by family to quell frenetic focus on his life. Scroll down for video . Attracting huge fan club: Hundreds of supporters of pilot Andreas Lubitz have taken to Facebook to make outlandish claims that he is being framed for murder by Lufthansa to hide mechanical faults with the plane . Voicing their views: Supporters have have set up a Facebook page (above) titled 'Andreas Lubitz A320, we are against the hunt' where they have been sharing their theories about the cause of the Alps disaster . Data extracted from the voice recorder last week revealed how senior pilot Patrick Sonderheimer desperately tried to smash the cockpit door down after being locked out by his colleague. Prosecutors said Lubitz then proceeded to set the plane on a collision course with the mountain, killing all 150 people on board. However, commenters allege that the recordings were manufactured in some way by Lufthansa to hide mechanical problems with the plane, according to a report by Vocativ. Hundreds of its followers are understood to be from the pilot's home of Montabaur in Germany and its surrounding area. One supporter, who claims to be a former classmate, said: 'I believe in the innocence of Andy!' They also point out that the second black box data recorder had not yet been recovered from the crash site, which they claim was also proof of a cover-up. Others also suggested that one of Lubitz's former girlfriends was paid by the media to say that he had once planned to commit a 'heinous act' that would go down in history. Lufthansa declined to comment. It has also emerged that Lubitz's home that he shared with his girlfriend in Dusseldorf has been blurred out on Google Maps (above) in apparent attempt by his family to quell frenetic focus on his life . Lubitz is understood to have shared his flat (right) with his maths teacher girlfriend Kathrin Goldbach . In a separate development relatives have apparently asked Google to blur out Lubitz's home in Dusseldorf that he shared with girlfriend Kathrin Goldbach from its Maps service. The move came at some point over the last week since the Alps disaster. Individuals and governments can ask for Google Maps images to be blurred over privacy concerns. After concerns from government officials in 2010, the internet giant offered an opt-out policy to Germans in order to 'obey local privacy laws.' Around 250,000 Germans are believed to have taken up the offer, according to Vocativ. The flat has been the scene of intense focus since the crash and reported claims that Miss Goldbach, 26, discovered that she was expecting his baby as little as two weeks ago. The pair, who are said to have had a patchy relationship over the last seven years, were letting the pregnancy news sink in when Lubitz crashed the jet, according to German newspaper Bild. Strict German privacy laws which prevented doctors treating Andreas Lubitz from telling his airline about his 'suicidal tendencies' were introduced as a consequence of the Nazis. The Germanwings pilot had been forced to stop his training because of severe depression and had received psychotherapy for several years before last week's Alps disaster. But German law meant it was left entirely up to him to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer, something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash. The findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in Germany on a patient's right to privacy, with Chancellor Angela Merkel proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law. Draconian legislation was initially brought in after World War Two to prevent a repeat of government spying during the Nazi era and subsequently the Stasi secret police in East Germany. This extends far beyond confidential medical data, however, to stringent protection of someone's identity, meaning many German publications only referred to Lubitz as Andreas L, even after his death. Further data protection laws traced back to 1907, which enshrines the 'right to your own picture', also mean images can only be published with the individual's consent. With respect to medical data, the criminal code means doctors are only allowed to breach confidentiality when they have reason to believe that sharing their knowledge could prevent 'a particularly serious crime' or a threat to someone's life. They can face a year in prison if they wrongly breach privacy, but up to five years in jail for withholding 'credible information about the planning or commission' of serious acts like murder. Despite the variation in sentences, doctors have tended to favour the individual's privacy. Many in Germany are now debating whether the potential to neutralise threats to public safety should trump doctor-patient privilege.", "raw_output": "Supporters set up Facebook page 'Andreas Lubitz, we are against the hunt'\nClaim black box was doctored to make it appear he deliberately crashed jet .\nHis home is muzzed from Google Maps after apparent request by his family .", "trunc_input": "Friends of killer pilot Andreas Lubitz claim he is being framed for murder as part of an elaborate cover-up by his airline company to hide mechanical faults with the plane.
