Created by an all-female team, the PSA uses statistics showing male dominance across industries to advocate for greater gender equality in entertainment and other sectors.",
  "A new study suggests that climate warming 1.4 million years ago enabled the earliest humans to venture into Western Europe for the first time. Researchers believe that the spread of hominins, our distant human ancestors, had previously been halted by colder and drier temperatures, but as conditions warmed above 13\u00b0C (55\u00b0F) and became more humid, they were able to migrate from Africa into Spain and eventually across Europe. The study, based on analysis of ancient tools found in southeast Spain, indicates that early human migration was strongly constrained by climate rather than cultural or geographical factors.",

  "Rangers boss Stuart McCall has been reassured that the club's removal from the London Stock Exchange will not affect his squad's promotion push, after the Ibrox faithful were rocked by Thursday's news that the club had been de-listed from the AIM market. The de-listing occurred because chairman-in-waiting Dave King failed to find a new nominated advisor, but McCall was told by club officials not to worry as funding and plans for the club will remain unchanged. McCall also expressed surprise at learning Rangers will owe Newcastle United \u00a3500,000 if they achieve promotion to the Premiership as part of their January loan deal for five Newcastle youngsters.",

  "Edinson Cavani's poor Champions League performance against Barcelona in PSG's 2-0 defeat may have ended any chance of him making a switch to Manchester United. The Uruguayan striker's lackluster display and underwhelming domestic form this season (11 goals in 32 games) would appear to have put to bed his prospects of filling Manchester United's looming striker void at Old Trafford. At 28 years old and with the painful experience of Radamel Falcao's failed loan spell still fresh, Louis van Gaal is unlikely to pursue another seemingly-fading South American striker.",
  "The title race appears to be over, but the Premier League survival battle heats up with just seven points separating Sunderland (15th, 29 points) from Leicester (20th). Sunderland's recent derby win has done them the world of good, and they need to make the most of initial fixtures against teams like Crystal Palace, Stoke, and Everton who have little to play for, before facing difficult closing matches against Arsenal and Chelsea. The analysis predicts Sunderland will be safe with 34 points, while Leicester and Burnley are expected to be relegated despite having some winnable home games remaining.",

  "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the Iran nuclear deal framework announced last week, arguing that it gives Iran too much flexibility by allowing thousands of centrifuges to keep operating and not shutting down any nuclear facilities. Netanyahu advocated for a \"third alternative\" of maintaining pressure for a better deal rather than accepting \"this bad deal or war,\" while Democrats like Senator Dianne Feinstein defended the framework as a workable opportunity to change regional dynamics. Republicans, including Senator Lindsey Graham, echoed Netanyahu's concerns about the deal giving Iran excessive flexibility and suggested that future presidents from either party could negotiate better terms.",

  "A geologist claims that a megalithic site in West Java, Indonesia, hidden beneath volcanic rubble, may contain the world's oldest pyramid built between 9,000-20,000 years ago - potentially four times older than Egypt's oldest pyramid which was built almost 5,000 years ago. The site at Gunung Padang, located 75 miles south of Jakarta at 2,903 feet above sea level among volcanoes and banana plantations, consists of chunks of volcanic rock arranged in terraces that may represent evidence of a powerful and advanced ancient civilization. However, the controversial findings are disputed by other experts who question whether such primitive peoples could have constructed such a complex structure thousands of years before previously known advanced civilizations.",

  "Richard Howarth, a 35-year-old father from Milton Keynes, claims he has developed an \"allergy\" to UKIP leader Nigel Farage that causes him to sweat, shake, and feel physically sick whenever he sees the politician on television. The medical recruitment consultant says he has to immediately change the channel when Farage appears or he becomes ill and anxious, with symptoms sometimes lasting for hours. A psychologist suggests Howarth's reactions are more likely the result of a phobia rather than an actual allergy, describing it as an irrational fear response to someone whose views are fundamentally opposed to his own.",

  "This Easter weekend, popular chocolate treats require significant exercise to burn off their calories, with a single Cr\u00e8me Egg containing 177 calories that takes 19 minutes of skipping to work off and nearly seven teaspoons of sugar - more than half the World Health Organisation's recommended daily limit of 50g. Exercise coaches recommend various activities to offset Easter indulgences, such as 30 minutes of core circuit training to burn off a small Lindt bunny (275 calories), 1 hour on a rowing machine or other muscle-activating cardio equipment for a larger bunny (540 calories), and 50 minutes of Zumba step class to burn the whopping 444 calories in a packet of mini eggs.

  "After almost 90 years since the traditional electricity pylon was introduced to the UK, thousands of 165ft towers that have been spoiling scenes of beauty across the land with their cat's cradle of high-voltage cables may have their days numbered. National Grid has revealed a new, more elegant T-pylon design that is a third shorter than the old lattice pylons but can carry the same amount of power (400,000 volts) and can be erected in just one day rather than a week. While these new T-pylons won't replace the existing 88,000 pylons currently in use, they will be used for new transmission routes, particularly for clean energy purposes, starting with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset.",

  "Student Drew Hollinshead, 21, was given a \u00a370 parking ticket after he pulled over into a disabled parking bay to help an elderly woman who had collapsed on the pavement and whom he thought might be dying.

Brand argues that the rate of discovery of new species currently outstrips the loss of species to extinction, and believes that focusing on widespread extinctions may be harmful as it makes conservation problems seem overwhelming rather than local and solvable. He contends that current extinction rates are far lower than historical mass extinctions and points to successful conservation efforts and species recoveries as evidence that biodiversity trends are actually positive.",

  "A new paper suggests that early Earth may have collided with a Mercury-like body about 4.5 billion years ago, a dramatic event that could explain why our planet has a hot core that gives it its magnetic field. The collision could also explain why certain rare-earth elements in Earth's mantle do not seem to originate from the planet's other building blocks like meteorites.
