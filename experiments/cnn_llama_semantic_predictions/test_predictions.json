  "Researchers suggest that a warming climate around 1.4 million years ago enabled the earliest humans to venture into Western Europe, enabling them to spread to distant regions. The warming climate allowed for the hominin species to branch out from Africa and eventually reach Europe. This shift occurred when temperatures rose above 13\u00b0C (55\u00b0F) and humidity increased, making it possible for hominins to scavenge carcasses with the help of tools. The new study provides evidence that climate change played a significant role in shaping the distribution of these early humans.",
