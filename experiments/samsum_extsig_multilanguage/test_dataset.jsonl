Especially you I mean.\nMell: I don't know. Sometimes I even forget that I should be missing them. In a way I do like this peace and quiet now.\nGloria: Small wonder. You had a hell of a time with them just before they went to college. I'd say you need to recover now.\nMell: I guess you're right.

I'd love it.\nGloria: Can't be better. I love your garden.\nMell: We're thinking about extending the terrace. I must show you my drawings, just a few ideas. It would be great to hear your opinion.\nGloria: I'd love to. But you know how little I know about garden design, or however you call it.\nMell: We'll have a look at them. Now the BBQ. At the weekend I suppose?\nGloria: Let me check the calendar. Here's our family planner. A horrible name, isn't it? So this weekend suits us fine. At the next one, on Saturday, Mark has penciled something in but I can't read it. So what about this Saturday?\nMell: Perfect. At least we know the weather holds. Shall I do the food and you the drinks?\nGloria: And I'll get us some dessert as well. \nMell: Very good indeed. It's always so easy going with you.\nGloria: Ta! You were thinking about Tad's sister?\nMell: I'm afraid so. I'm so happy she moved up to Scotland and I don't have to put up with her trying to run my household. Tad feels relieved too.\nGloria: Good riddance! I could really never warm up to her.\nMell: Nobody can! Anyway she's gone and we're going to have a fantastic barbecue. Without her.\nGloria: Yes, we are.

Really, he knows what I think and I know what he thinks so I don't bring up certain things. I don't want to argue, but if it keeps happening, I don't see the point of talking to him\nKate: I'm angry every single time I talk with him\nMary: Eh, I don't get why he keeps doing it. What did he say?\nKate: I don't want to get worked up over it again, but really usual stuff. He watched a programme about the refugees and went on a rant about it\nMary: oh god\nKate: right?! I don't know why I'm still talking with him. I tried to talk some sense into him, apparently with no luck\nMary: What did you tell him?\nKate: What I usually tell him. He was an immigrant once, he was working abroad, I sent him all the data and research, statistics, everything.\nMary: I'm afraid Chris may be too pig-headed for that\nKate: Pfff I bet he didn't even read anything. He's just watching the nationalists, Trump and all those idiots, listens to everything they're saying on the telly instead of just thinking for once\nMary: I know, to be honest I kind of avoid these subjects when I'm talking with him\nKate: Well, I try to as well, but as you can see he can't stop himself\nKate: I know he's our friend and we go out often, but I'm not sure I can do it any more, I don't want be friends with someone who thinks that Mexican children are worse and that they should be kept away from the US\nMary: Oh my god he said that?\nKate: Yes :/\nMary: Jesus, I knew he has strong views, but to say something like that? That's a bit too much\nKate: You're telling me this. I think we should reconsider this let's say friendship, because if every conversation will lead to something like this, I'm not interested in staying in touch with him\nMary: No wonder\n\nPlease write a very short 1 sentence summary in Italian.\nConsider including the following information: Kate; Chris :/\nMary; purpose\nMary; much\nKate; Mary; luck\nMary; fight; oh god\nKate.."}

Bangalore and Chennai and other places. Nearly 90 million speakers, brother.\nTim: Is it one of those written right to left?\nSamuel: No, it is written left to right. It is based on Brahmin script, our writing. If you trace it back far enough it all comes from the Phoenicians, like English writing the same.\nTim: Wow. \nTim: So it must be pretty big, then, Teluguland?\nSamuel: It is 23 provinces, Anna. But we are not rich as in the north, so many people here are still working for less than a hundred dollars a whole month.\nTim: So what is the word for \"younger brother\" if \"Anna\" means \"elder brother?\"\nSamuel: Thammu or Thammadu. You can call me Thammu. I am younger than you.\nTim: how old are you, I would have sid about the same as me in your photo.\nSamuel: How old are you, Anna? \nTim: 55\nSamuel: Well there you are you see. I am 35 only. So you are my Anna and I am your Thammadu. \nTim: Wow sorry to say it but you do look old for 35:\nSamuel: That is because it is not an easy life when you are not earning much money, Anna. We work very hard and have very little. But still we are thankful for what we do have.\n\nPlease write a very short 1 sentence summary in Italian.\nConsider including the following information: Tim; Anna; 55\nSamuel; brother Tim; called Anna.."}

u get all the news in one place. Then u can choose what to read and what not.\nNancy: Sounds sensible. Does it have something 4 fashion?\nPhil: Probably so. Not sure, though.\nNancy: How about u, Vic?\nVic: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.\nPhil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. \nVic: What do u mean?\nPhil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u.\nVic: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters.\nPhil: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook.\nNancy: So no one uses 4 example Instagram?\nVic: I do. \nPhil: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online. \nNancy: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram.\nPhil: I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast. \nVic: That's not all ppl post on Instagram!\nPhil: So, what else?\nVic: Depends on ur interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :)\nPhil: And does this motivate u to train?\nVic: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. \nNancy: What do u think about Tumblr?\nPhil: What?\nVic: Heard about it, but never had an account.\nNancy: It's a microblogging website. U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. And ppl can observe u!\nPhil: Don't have that much time to write a blog.\nVic: Me neither. \nPhil: Nancy, y do u ask these questions? ;)\nNancy: I have my reasons ;)\n\nPlease write a very short 1 sentence summary in Italian.\nConsider including the following information: Phil; news online ;)\nPhil; Tumblr; ;)\nNancy.."}

coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten. From what I've heard, being allergic is far worse, because you have an allergic reaction that can be lethal, while being intolerant can make feel you some unpleasant symptoms, but I don't think may lead to your death\nJack: Why are you asking? Is there something wrong?\nCharles: Hm, I don't know, I feel that I may be allergic or something\nMonica: Do you have any symptoms? Check those articles:\nMonica: <file_other>, <file_other>\nKaren: I think that you may have a very very light allergy at best, otherwise you would have known - trust me\nKaren: When it comes to intolerance... I know it's very hip to be gluten intolerant, but I don't believe that suddenly half of the population is gluten intolerant. Unless you have a coeliac disease, I think you're fine\nJack: My friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she's absolutely fine\nCharles: I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much\nKaren: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better\nMonica: I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I'm much better now\nJack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?\nMonica: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens\nCharles: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare\nKaren: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?\nCharles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet\nKaren: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm\nMonica: You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat\nCharles: Thanks! I'm really worried, because it's getting worse and I have no idea what's happening with me\n\nPlease write a very short 1 sentence summary in Italian.\nConsider including the following information: Karen; Jack; diet\nKaren; real nightmare\nKaren; eat\nCharles; feel better\nMonica; absolutely fine\nCharles; fine\nJack; happens\nCharles; <file_other>\nKaren; gluten intolerance; harm\nMonica; death\nJack.."}
