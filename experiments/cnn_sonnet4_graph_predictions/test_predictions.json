  "Spanish researchers have found that a warming climate may have enabled the earliest humans to venture into Western Europe 1.4 million years ago, suggesting that climate change significantly impacted human migration patterns.

The paper, published in the Journal of Human Evolution, suggests that climate change affected the availability of resources and enabled the earliest known hominins to inhabit new regions 1.4 million years ago, as evidenced by Oldowan tools found at archaeological sites in southeast Spain.",

  "Stewart Brand argues that despite warnings the planet is facing a sixth mass extinction like the five mass extinction events in Earth's history, widespread extinctions may actually be overstated as many threatened species are recovering and the current extinction rate of one percent per decade is lower than the species discovery rate.

  "ISIS has created an extensive bureaucratic system with many official documents relating to matters like birth certificates, vaccination schedules, and rent disputes, demonstrating how the group sees itself as a legitimate government operating under Sharia law conditions. After ISIS fighters swept through areas like Mosul, they preserved existing systems like universities and hospitals but imposed strict Islamic interpretations, banning subjects like archaeology and democracy while maintaining services like healthcare and education. What distinguishes ISIS from groups like the Taliban is their more pragmatic approach to governance - they allow girls' education until age 15, permit vaccinations, and focus on winning over populations by lowering bread prices and addressing local complaints, all while using religious justification to present themselves as a moral authority.",

The outgoing government's inability to effectively combat Boko Haram - whose major targets are actually Islamic population centers rather than Christians - and widespread corruption that has impoverished Nigeria's poor despite the country's oil wealth, led voters to support Buhari's promise to tackle both terrorism and corruption. Buhari's victory represents hope for reform in a country where the author observed during a visit that the government could provide security in some areas but utterly failed in others, while the Boko Haram terrorist emergency continuing in Muslim areas may have actually benefited the previous administration politically.",

  "Oxford scientists propose that Earth's formation involved a collision with a Mars-sized body similar to Mercury about 4.5 billion years ago, which would explain why Earth's core generates heat for its magnetic field and why the planet's crust and mantle contain higher ratios of rare-earth elements like samarium and neodymium than typical meteorites. This Mercury-like object, rich in sulfur but poor in oxygen, could have provided the radioactive materials needed to drive Earth's molten iron core, and researchers suggest this same Mars-sized body may also be responsible for the moon's formation. The theory builds on current models of planetary formation where smaller bodies coalesced to form larger planets like Earth, but addresses previously unexplained aspects of our planet's composition and internal structure.",

  "An internal ISIS report detailing its organizational structure reveals that while ISIS presents itself as a global religious organization, it has actually thrived because of a local cause - Sunni rebellion in Iraq and Syria - and is largely led by former secular Baathist officers from Saddam Hussein's army who use radical Islam as a tool for power and control. Reports suggest that people living under ISIS rule are growing disenchanted with the brutal theocratic dictatorship, as no one has ever voted ISIS into power anywhere, and ISIS might find its greatest threat comes from within its own territory rather than external enemies. Despite the significant threat ISIS poses through its sophisticated messaging and recruitment machine that attracts alienated young Muslims worldwide, the group's main focus appears to be building a caliphate in the Middle East rather than directly attacking the West.",

  "China's cybercensors have developed a new cyberweapon called the \"Great Cannon\" that attacks servers outside China's borders, including in the United States, representing a powerful attack capability that goes beyond their traditional \"Great Firewall\" which monitors tons of traffic to block content. Study authors found that Beijing used this weapon to target services like Greatfire.org (run by Chinese expats bent on fighting censorship) and GitHub through massive distributed denial of service attacks, using unsuspecting web users' browsers as unwitting participants. While the Great Firewall passively monitors and blocks traffic, the Great Cannon actively weaponizes internet traffic to attack foreign servers, marking a significant escalation in China's cyber capabilities.",
  "Ciudad Real Airport in Spain, which was built in 2009 for over \u20ac1 billion to handle overflow from Madrid's Barajas airport, is now being sold for just one pound after closing in 2012 when airlines stopped flying from its terminals.

The 23-year-old Ings, who is strongly linked with moves to Manchester United or Liverpool when his contract expires in summer, missed Burnley's best chance in their 1-0 defeat to Everton on Saturday.
