  "Researchers suggest that a warming climate around 1.4 million years ago enabled the spread of distant human ancestors, the hominins, from Africa into Spain, where they eventually spread across Europe. Climate change impacted human migration, allowing them to move to new regions. An ancient human ancestor known as 'Nutcracker Man' lived on a diet of tiger nuts, worms, and grasshoppers, which may explain why the related species, Paranthropus boisei, had distinctive powerful jaws and large, flat molar teeth. The warming climate allowed these early hominins to inhabit the region, where they were supported by simple Oldowan tools.",

Cavani has struggled to impress this season, despite being linked with a transfer to Manchester United. His disappointing display against Barcelona may have also raised concerns among Manchester United, who have been keeping a close eye on him due to his past performances.

He said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager. The officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement.
